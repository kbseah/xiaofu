<div class="translation"><h1>Chapter 3</h1></div>
<h2 id="h2_0">世諱部<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>墨憨子曰。貧與賤。世所諱也。余亦因而諱之。然賤而不貧。或遂忘其賤。貧而不賤。誰肯憐其貧。此又可微世風矣。雖然。貧莫如丐。而丐中有孝子。賤莫如妓而妓中有義娼。壽于稗史。芬于口類。貧賤固不足諱也。不足諱又何笑焉。笑貧賤中之可笑者。亦以笑世之笑貧賤者。集世諱部。［68］</p>
<h2 id="h2_1">貧士過冬<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>冬至節近。貧士向人愁曰。我過年之物。反有二件矣。恨無物過冬耳。曰。何不且移過年者過冬乎。士蹙額曰是移不得的。問何物。曰。芝蔴箕。石灰。</p>
<h2 id="h2_2">遇偷<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>偷兒入一貧家。徧摸。一無所有。乃唾地開門而去。貧漢于床上見之。喚曰。賤可為我開了門去。偷兒曰。你這箇人呌我賤。也忒難。［69］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Meeting a burglar (1)</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A burglar broke into a poor man's house, but couldn't find anything worth stealing despite searching all over. So he spat on the ground and opened the door to leave. The poor man was lying on the bed and saw him, and called out: "Lowlife! Open the door and get out of here." The burglar said: "It's just too much if even someone like you calls me a lowlife."</p></div>
<p>一說。喚賊關門。賊笑曰。我且問你。關他做甚麼。亦有味。舊說云。賊。可替我帶上了門。賊曰。是這等貧懶所以做不得人家。貧漢曰。我做人家與你偷麼。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>Another version says that the poor man called out to the burglar to shut the door behind him. The burglar laughed and said: "I'll ask you instead - is there any point in closing it?" This has more wit. An old version has the man telling the burglar: "Will you latch the door for me." The burglar said: "It's this sort of damned laziness that keeps you from making something of yourself." The poor man replied: "Why should I bother making something only for you to steal it?" </p></div>
<h2 id="h2_3">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>賊見有穿新衣者。疑其富夜掘其壁。其人故貧。未睡遇掘䖏。即將鍋盖抵檔。賊嘆曰。看他不惟身上好穿着。屋裡也好裝摺。其人應云。你外面看來好。不知我裡面那東掩西。𦅈捕得好若。［70］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Meeting a burglar (2)</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A burglar saw someone wearing new clothes, and thought that he might be rich, and so tailed him home and broke into his house at night. The man was actually poor, and was not yet asleep, and so fended off the burglar with pots and pans. The burglar sighed and said: "He not only wears fine things, but also has a well-furnished house." The man replied, saying: "It looks good to you on the outside, but you don't know how painstakingly they have been patched up on the inside." </p></div>
<h2 id="h2_4">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>偷兒入一貧家。其家止米一小甕。置卧床前。偷兒觧裙布地。方取甕傾米。床上人竊窺之潛抽其裙去。急呼有賊。々應聲曰。眞箇有賊。方纔一條裙在此。轉眼就不見了。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Meeting a burglar (3)</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A burglar broke into a poor household. This household kept its grain in a small jar standing in front of the bed. The burglar took off his robe and set in on the ground, before going to pour out the grain from the jar. The person lying on the bed secretly took away the burglar's robe, before crying "thief!" The burglar said: "There has been a thief! I had just put my robe down there, and now it's gone!" </p></div>
<p>一說偷兒既失裙。乃曰。此䖏原來有賊的。語亦冷亦趣。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>Another version says that the burglar had already lost his robe, and said: "There was already a burglar here." The joke is best told with a straight face.</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_5">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［71］一貧士素好鋪張。偷兒夜襲之。室如也。罵而去。士摸床頭數錢追贈之。嘱曰。君此來。雖極怠慢。然人前萬望包荒。</p>
<h2 id="h2_6">兩衫<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>甲乙俱貧。隆冬時。甲穿单布衫二。乙穿夾布襖一。甲笑乙曰。虧＝左虛＝你一件衣襖。如何禦寒。乙曰。你我皆兩臂。何以笑我。甲曰。我難道不多你此兒。乙曰。多甚麼。甲云。可是多兩箇底襇。［72］</p>
<h2 id="h2_7">被<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>貧漁夫婦于冬天以網為被。中夜。以指透網外。私相謂曰。如此寒夜。虧＝左虛＝那無被的。如何熬過。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Blanket</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A poor fisherman used his net as a blanket in the winter. In the middle of the night, he poked his finger through the net, and said to himself: "On such a cold night as this, it must be so hard on those who don't have blankets. I wonder how they can survive."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_8">借債<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有持券借債者。主人曰。不須券。只畵一幅行樂圖來可也。問其故。曰。怕日後討債時。不是這般面孔耳。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Debt</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A debtor went looking for a loan. The creditor said to him, "I don't need a loan certificate. All I ask for is a portrait of you." When asked why, he replied, "I fear that when I go to collect on the debt, you won't be showing this face to me."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_9">戴笆斗<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有避債者。偶以事出門恐人見之。乃頂一笆斗而行。［73］為一債家所識。殚其斗曰。所約如何。姑應曰。明日。已而雨大作。斗上㸃擊無美。其人荒甚。乃曰。一㮣明日。</p>
<h2 id="h2_10">說出來<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一人為索逋者索苦。辭之不去。乃曰。你定要我說出來麼。索逋者疑其道已心病嘿然而去。如此數次。一日發狠曰。由你說出來罷。我不怕你。其人又曰。真箇要我說出來。曰真要你說。曰。不還了。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Say it out loud</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A creditor was having a hard time collecting a debt. When he pressed the debtor, he instead got the reply, "do you really want me to say it out loud?" Feeling uneasy at this, the creditor sighed and went away. This happened several times, until one day he decided to buckle down and insist, saying, "just say it out loud, I'm not afraid of you." Whereupon the debtor replied, "do you really want me to say it?" "Just say it." "I'm not paying you back."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_11">說夢<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［74］欠債者謂討債者曰。我命不久矣。昨夜夢見身［死］。討債者曰。陰陽相反。夢死反得活也。欠債者曰。還有一夢。々見還了你的債。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Interpreting dreams</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A debtor told his creditor: "I don't have long to live. Last night, I dreamed that I was dead." The creditor replied: "Dreams are the inverse of reality. Dreaming about your death means that you'll live." The debtor said: "Oh there was one more dream. I dreamed that I paid back my debt."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_12">坐椅<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一家索債人多。椅俱占滿。更有坐檻上者。主人私于坐檻者曰。汝明日早來。坐檻者意其先完己事。乃揚言以散衆人。次日黎明即往。叩其相約之意。荅曰。早來可先占把交椅。［75］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Chairs</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A household had so many creditors seeking payment, that all their chairs were occupied, and some were even sitting on the threshold. The householder spoke privately with those sitting on the threshold, saying, "why don't you come back early tomorrow?" They thought that this meant he would resolve their business at this time, and so chattering among themselves, they dispersed. The next day at dawn, they came to the house. Knocking on the door, they expressed their intentions. Instead, they were told, "I meant that if you came early you would get to sit in a chair."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_13">保債<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有負債者。為債主人所逼。自投眢井。債主人恐甚。呼之出。曰吾不出矣。出。無以償汝。債主人曰。即出。當為你焚券。曰。甚善。雖然。我不出矣。吾家貧甚。債主人曰。即出。當為尔綃致錢粟。又曰。甚善。雖然。吾猶不出也。吾有好友。貧更甚。汝必貸以十金。債主人曰。吾為惠于尔足矣。何能及尔友乎。曰。苐貸之。有我在不妨。</p>
<h2 id="h2_14">轉債<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［76］一人借銀五兩。約四分起利。滿十月。應還七兩矣。謂債主人曰。目下來不及。汝找三兩與我。轉十兩文契罷。從之。又十月。應還十四兩矣。又曰今年也來不及。加我一兩轉十五兩罷。債主以所找甚寡。復勉從之。再十月。應還二十一兩矣。及往索。又乞找四兩。轉二十五兩。債主有難色。其人便怒曰。我那一年本利不清。你直如此作難。</p>
<h2 id="h2_15">扛<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［77］有欠債屢索不還者。主人怒。命僕軰潛伺。扛之以歸至中途。僕暫歇。其人謂僕曰。快走罷。歇在此。又被別家抗去。不關我事。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Taken</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>There was a debtor who repeatedly refused to honor his debt. The creditor was furious, and sent a servant to kidnap him. While carrying him back, the servant took a break by the road. The debtor said to him, "you'd better hurry along. If you dally here, and someone else manages to grab me, it's not my problem."</p></div>
<p>舊話云。<span class="largerText"><span class="nn" id="nn_0">㝠王</span></span>命拘蔡青。鬼卒誤以為債精也。拘至案。王知。其謬。命放囘。債精曰。此䖏權借一躲。其寔不須去了。扛他去者。亦恐不易打發。</p>
<h2 id="h2_16">小欠<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有小欠者。每索。必辭以不在家。一日又辭。索者識其［78］音。正欠主也。曰。汝在家。如何囘我。應曰。我非某人。乃其親春耳。索者濕破紙窓。認出之。其人即大怒曰。所欠。幾何而壞吾窓也。俟補好。當還汝。索者曰。是不難。即為補訖。復索之。應曰。如今又不在家了。</p>
<p>相傳此為祝京兆枝山回魚錢事。京兆有債僻。每肩與出。則索逋者纍々相随。盖債家謂不往索。恐其復借而京兆亦恬然不為恠也。嘗托言款客。往友家借銀鑲鐘數事。既借。主人心疑。遣僕随其與［79］察之。則己汲々擗銀而棄胚于外矣。僕追止之。京兆曰。借我。即我物也。汝欲用。亦拿一兩事去。不妨。又嵗盡。乏用。遍走柬于所親知。托言弔喪。借得白圓領共五十餘件。并付質庫。［過］嵗首。諸家奴雲集。則皆索白圓領者也。覔典票。已失之矣。事極可笑。然于京兆不妨奇品。</p>
<h2 id="h2_17">定親<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一人如廁。偶廁先有女子在焉。偶失凈紙。因言若有［80］知趣的給我。願為之婦。其人聞知。即以自用者。從壁隙中扥逓與。女凈訖。逕去。其人嘆曰。雖定得這頭親事。屁股頭何日乾淨。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Betrothal </h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A man went to the toilet, where there happened to be already a woman in the stall. The woman had forgotten to bring toilet paper, and so said aloud: "If anyone could give me some, I would be willing to be his wife." The man heard this and gave her the toilet paper that he brought for himself through a crack in the wall. The woman cleaned herself up, and left. The man sighed, saying: "I may have managed to find myself a wife today, but when will I be able to clean my bum?"</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_18">乞兒<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有乞兒積粟二酒瓶。自謂極富。一日與伴行市中。聞路人問荅。言今嵗収［過］米三千石矣。丐躡伴足謂曰。你［聽］這人說謊。不信他家有許多酒瓶。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Beggar</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A beggar accumulated two wine bottles full of millet, and considered himself to be rich. One day, he went to the market with a companion. Along the way he overheard someone saying that he had stored up three hundred tons of grain. The beggar stepped on his friend's foot and said: "You hear that? What a liar! I don't believe that anyone can have that many wine bottles at home."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_19">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［81］一乞兒戒食狗肉。衆丐勸之。必不可。曰。我戒之久矣。衆曰。你便戒他。々倒不戒你。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Beggar (2)</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A beggar gave up eating dog meat. The other beggars told him that he couldn't do that. He said: "I've given it up for a long while." They replied: "You may have given it up, but it hasn't given you up."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_20">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一乞兒病腿爛。卧金剛腳下。狗往●＝左『食』右『舌』＝之。乞兒曰。畜生。直恁性急。我［死］後少不得都是你的。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Beggar (3)</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A beggar had a lame leg, and so hid his gold under that leg. His dog went to sniff at it, and the beggar said: "Stupid beast! What's the rush? When I die, all of it will be yours anyway."</p></div>
<p>或述此笑話云。是嘲敗子者。余曰。還是嘲敗子之父。或問何說。余曰。他做人家忒呌化樣了。定然養出這等畜生來。［82］</p>

<h2 id="h2_22">復入<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一僕嫌主貧。逃外。後主人得第。求復入。主人不許。堅求不已。主人怒。呼進。責二十板。逐之。至大門不肯出［83］門者勸之速行。僕曰。我如今是他嫡々親々的家人了。門者曰。既打了。决不用你。如何是他家人。僕曰。不是他家人。怎打得我。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Going back</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A servant fancied that his master was poor, and so ran away. The master later won his degree to be an official, and the servant asked to return to his household, but he master wouldn't allow it. The servant kept on begging, and the master got angry, ordered him to come in, and punished him with twenty lashes. After this, the servant stood just inside the gate, unwilling to step out. The doorkeeper advised him to leave quickly. The servant said: "As of today I am a bona fide member of his household." The doorkeeper said: "Since he beat you, and definitely doesn't want to keep you, how can you be a member of his household?" The servant replied: "If I wasn't a member of his household, how could he have the right to beat me?"</p></div>

The neighbor discovered that he was out of toilet paper, and said that he would be willing to pay a cash for it. The man happened to have extra paper, and earned a cash. He thought that there was much profit to be made from this, and the next day returned carrying a bale of toilet paper, and set up by the toilet hoping that someone would buy it. Someone who knew about this said: "Yesterday was a chance occurrence. This is a place for shitting (chugong, lit. ...), how can one hope to be making money?"</p></div>
