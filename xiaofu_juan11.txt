＊＊謬誤部
墨憨子曰。嘗聞詞隱先生論曲。家之誤云。有名周惟盛者。吳音盛與臟同。因呼為周惟臟。後又譌為周皮匠。未幾逕稱為周師父矣。又有童子報新聞于主人曰。頃過學院門。見一黑面秀才。倒步而入背宗師而跪。宗師命扑其肚皮。是何為也。主人疑而察之。則一士以反帶儒巾被責耳。事之可笑多［124］有若此。何必聚三十六州鐵。乃打成一錯乎。集謬誤部。

`**The stolen cow
`A man came before a magistrate to report that his cow had been stolen. The magistrate asked him when the cow was stolen, and he answered: "Tomorrow." A court subordinate could not help but laugh.

＊＊揵踢
一童子弄揵子。偶踢下井。乃俯視井。對影哭曰。還了［125］我。父問之。訴曰。揵子為井中兒所［収］。父亦臨井。見己影謂曰。汝家兒子要踢揵子。我家兒子難道不要的。
`**Shuttlecock
`A boy was playing with a shuttlecock, but accidentally kicked it into a well. He looked down into the well, and saw his own reflection. Crying, he said: "Return it to me!" His father heard this, and said: "The shuttlecock has been taken by the boy in the well." He also went to the well, and saw his own reflection there, saying: "Your boy wants to play with the shuttlecock, but that doesn't mean my boy shouldn't get a chance to play!"
＊＊行令
一人出令曰。春雨如膏。或疑為糕也。曰。夏雨如饅頭。或又疑為夏禹也。曰。周文王像塔餅。
`**Toast

＊＊又

`**A matter of age
`A man with a newborn girl received a matchmaking offer for a boy aged two (Chinese count newborns as being one year old). The man was furious, saying, "my daughter is a newborn and their son is one, so if my daughter were ten, they would propose that she marry someone aged twenty? Why would I want such an old son-in-law?" His wife heard this, and said, "you've got it wrong. Our daughter may be one, but next year she will be the same age as the boy, so what is wrong with that?"
＊＊看鏡
有出外生理者。妻嘱回時。須買牙梳。夫問其狀。妻指新月示之。夫貨畢將歸。忽憶妻語。因看月輪正滿。遂買一鏡回。妻照之。罵曰。牙梳不買。如何反娶一妾。母聞之。往勸。忽見鏡。照云。我兒有心費錢。如何娶個婆子。遂至訐訟。官差往拘之。見鏡慌云。如何就有捉違限的。及審。置鏡于案。官照見。大怒曰。夫妻不和事。何［128］必央［鄉］宦來講。

`**Cap
`A servant was accompanying his master to take an exam, and accidentally dropped the hat box. The servant cried out, "crud! I've made a blunder." The master said to him, "that is unrefined speech.
