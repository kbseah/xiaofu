{nn/墨憨子/nn}曰。{gg/古艷/gg}云者。言從古所艷羨也。{{粟紅貫朽。}}乘堅策肥。人亦孰不欲富貴哉。{所以} 䖏富貴者。毋為人笑難耳。昔某翁有三子。{nn/翁/nn}且［死］。命之言志。伯曰。願堆金百萬。仲曰。願歷官台鼎。季曰。願生大眼一雙。翁訝之。季曰。我須大着眼。看他富貴能幾時鳴呼。慶弔同門。如之=何不自警也=。集古艷部。［8］
``The Master of Mo-han Studio says: Ancient treasures refer to those things that have been the subject of admiration since days of old. In times of plenty, grain is allowed to molder in the store-house and thread is allowed to rot, while men ride sturdy carriages and whip fat horses. What person doesn't want riches? Those who dwell in riches can hardly avoid being the subject of laughter.
``There was an old man who had three sons. As he was nearing death, he asked them what they aspired to do. The eldest said: I want fortune - a heap of a million gold pieces. The middle son said: I want to be an official - one of the great officers of state. The youngest son said: I want a pair of big eyes. The father was surprised and asked why. The son replied: I need a big pair of eyes, to see how long their riches can last.
``Fortune and tragedy are disciples of the same master. Who will not take heed of this warning? Here begins the chapter on Ancient Treasures.
＊＊富翁帶巾

``**Rich man's kerchief
``A rich man instructed a cowherd to dry his kerchief in the sun. The cowherd put it on the horns of his cow to dry. The cow came to the water, saw its own reflection, and fled in shock. The cowherd went around asking: "Has anyone seen a cow wearing a kerchief?"

＊＊借牛
有走柬借牛于富翁者。富翁方對客。{gg/諱不識字/gg}。偽啟緘視之。對來使曰。知道了。少停我自來也。
``**Borrowing a cow
``Someone sent a letter to a rich man, asking to borrow a cow from him. When the letter came, the rich man was with a guest, and didn't want to reveal that he was illiterate. And so he opened the letter, pretended to read it, and said to the messenger: "Everything is well, in a moment I will come in person."
