<h2 id="h2_0">腐流部<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<div class="translation"><h2>Decadence and decay</h2></div>
<p>墨憨子曰。人有恆言。曰腐儒。腐儒。言朽敗不任也。朽敗不任。何以儒為。勝國區民。八娼。九儒。十丐。夫列于娼之下。丐之上者。今之儒是己。直是可涕可悲。豈直可笑而已哉。集腐流部。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>The Master of Mohan Studio says: There is a common phrase "rotten scholar", that refers to those whose values are decayed and who are untrustworthy. With decayed values and untrustworthiness, how can they be called Confucian scholars? In the classification of society, eighth are the prostitutes, ninth the scholars, and tenth the beggars. So scholars rank below prostitutes but above beggars. Today's scholars are thus - worthy of our sorrow and pity, and not just our laughs. </p></div>
<div class="translation"><p>(The ranks of society referred to above are, in full: officials, court functionaries, Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, physicians, craftsmen, hunters, prostitutes, Confucian scholars, and beggars. Some variants of this list exist: see http://baike.baidu.com/view/215358.htm. The original version is from the Song text 郑恩肖《心史》(see http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&file=98130&page=172) but there may be differences between editions.)</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_1">老童生<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>虎出山而回。呼肚饑其黨曰。今日固不遇一人乎。對［30］曰。遇而不食。問其故。對曰。始一和尚來。因䏲氣不食。次一秀才來。因酸氣不食。最後一童生來。亦不曾食。問童生何為不食。曰。怕咬傷了牙齒。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Old student</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A tiger returned from a day out on the mountain. Upon hearing its stomach rumbling, its companion said: "Didn't you encounter a single person today?" The first tiger said: "I met some but didn't eat them." The second asked why. The first replied: "First there was a monk who came by, but he stank and I couldn't bear to eat him. Then there was a graduate (xiucai) who came by, but he had a sour smell and I couldn't bear to eat him. Last there was a student (tongsheng) who came by, but I had even less interest in eating him." When asked why he didn't eat the student, he said: "I didn't want to injure my teeth." (Giles, 39b)</p></div>
<p>末句。舊云筋骨老凝不堪食。少蘊籍。年少童生須仔細防老虎。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>A final word: The old saying is that old and sinewy bones and tendons are not fit for eating. That's no surprise. Young students should carefully guard against tigers. </p></div>
<h2 id="h2_2">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>縣官考童生。傍晚。忽聞厰角喧閙。問之。門子稟云。童子拿差了拄拐。在那裡認。［31］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Old student (2)</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A county official was administering an examination for students (tongsheng). In the late evening, there was suddenly a loud commotion in a corner of the examination hall. He asked what was going on, and a doorman reported: One of the students had taken the wrong walking-stick by mistake, and they were sorting it out among themselves.</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_3">未冠<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>童子有老而未冠者。考官問之。以孤寒無網巾對。官曰。只你一嘴鬍髯。勾結網矣。對曰。新冠不好帶得白網巾。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Unsuccessful</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A student was advanced in years but had never passed the examinations. The examination official asked him why, and he replied: "Because I am a poor orphan who cannot afford the cap." The official said: "You have a full beard around your mouth, that hair should be enough to weave a cap." The student replied: "It wouldn't be seemly for a new graduate to wear a white cap (indicating mourning)." </p></div>
<div class="translation"><p>(Giles, 42)</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_4">包巾<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>老童生臨死。見子孫滿前。嘱曰。我殮時。若帶帽枉却一生讀書。若帶巾又恐僣分。因嘆氣曰。仍以包巾束髮罷。［32］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Scarf</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>An old pupil (tongsheng) was close to death, with his sons and grandsons gathered around him. He told them: "When I am dressed for burial, if I wear a commoner's hat it would be a waste of my entire life of study, but if I wear a scholar's cap it would be a presumption to a status I haven't earned." He sighed and continued: "So just wrap up my hair in a scarf."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_5">得頭<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>或問童生之父曰。令郎卷面遍。已許取乎。曰。縣尊極愛小兒卷。得頭不已。問如何得頭。乃搖首曰。是橫得。</p>
<h2 id="h2_6">儒學碑<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>儒學碑亭新完。一士［攜］妓往視。見負重。戲謂妓曰。汝父在此。何不拜。妓即下拜云。我的爺。看你這等蹭蹬何時能出學門。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>(bowdlerized by Giles, no. 25)</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_7">德行<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［33］士有好飲宿娼。而賄得德行者。或嘲之曰。聞顏子有負郭田三十頃。如何得窮。一人曰。他簞<span class="smallerText">單</span>食<span class="smallerText">是</span>瓢飲。所以窮了。又一人曰。闞飲到去不多。都買了德行頭兒。</p>

<div class="translation"><p>Another version says that a xiucai graduate died, and came before the Lord of Hell. The graduate said that his own literary abilities were very sharp. When the Lord of Hell by chance let out a fart, the scholar promptly came up with a verse like the one above. The Lord of Hell was glad and granted him one more year of life. When he died for the second time, he was once again brought to the Lord of Hell. This time the Lord of Hell was not at court. One of his demonic minions came to report that a xiucai graduate was here to see him. He asked which one, and the minion said: "The one who writes stinky verses." </p></div>

<div class="translation"><p>A bad teacher was in class, when a student asked: "Can you explain 'the way of the Great Learning'?" The teacher feigned drunkenness, and said: "You should ask me again when I'm sober." When he got home, he told his wife what happened, and she said: "The 'Great Learning' is the name of a book, and 'the way' refers to the main theme in that book." The teacher nodded. The next day he addressed his students: "You ignorant fools! When I was drunk yesterday you insisted on asking me questions, but today you are so quiet. You asked me yesterday about 'The way of Great Learning'..." and he proceeded to repeat what his wife had told him the night before. A student then asked: "What does it mean 'is to illustrate illustrious virtue?'" (the next line from the Great Learning.)

The next morning, the wife prepared chicken and hot wine to feed her husband. He laughed and said: "I know you must be thanking your teacher. How was he?"

<div class="translation"><p>Two dusty old scholars had a long-running dispute - each considered his own interpretation to be the truth, and the other's to be false. Unable to resolve it between themselves, they decided to seek the opinion of Confucius. Confucius came down from on high, made the customary salute, and said: "My way is very broad; why need there be exact agreement? Both of you gentlemen have correct interpretations. I appreciate both; neither may be said to be false." They were both overjoyed and withdrew. One of the disciples asked Confucius: "Why did you have to flatter them so?" Confucius replied: "With people like these, just pander a bit to them and move on. Why encourage them?"</p></div>

He asked what he had done wrong, and the scholar replied: "Don't you know that Confucius didn't ask about the horses? Why did you then tell me about the horses?"

He then spoke again: "I am not doing this from lustfulness, but to make our empire bountiful," and he gave another thrust. And once again: "I am not doing this out of lustfulness, but to be fruitful and multiply," and he gave another thrust. A disciple asked: "What did he say before the fourth thrust?" A knowledgeable man replied: "What more is to be said? A dusty old scholar such as this would have been finished in three thrusts." </p></div>
