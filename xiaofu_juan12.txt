＊笑府卷十二
`*Chapter 12
＊＊日用部

＊＊又
一人網巾破。用布補之。久而布多于騌矣。或曰。如此網巾。帶之熱＝上執＝否。荅曰。難道布唐巾不帶了。
`**Hairnet (3)
`A man's hairnet was broken, and he patched it up with cloth. After some time, there was more cloth than horsehair. Someone said to him: "Doesn't it get very warm wearing such a hairnet?" He replied: "What do you mean? Does no one wear cloth caps any more?" 
此與皮補鞋說難道靴不穿了同意。又一人蒲鞋［147］破。屢用皮補。或見之。訝曰。你的皮鞋。如何帶此蒲在上。
`This is like the man who repaired his sandals with leather, saying: "Does no one wear boots any more?" Another man's straw sandals were broken, and he repaired them with leather. Someone saw them and was shocked: "Why is there straw in your leather shoes?" 
＊＊希網巾
有見人帶希網巾者。訝之曰。尊頭要送與何人。其人不觧。問之。荅曰。既不送人。如何套盤絡在上。

`#wordplay
＊＊鞋襪訟
一人鞋襪俱破。鞋歸咎于襪。々亦歸咎于鞋。相與訟之于神。々亦不能决。乃拘脚跟證之。脚跟曰。小的一向逐出在外。何由得知。
`**The shoe and sock argue
`A man's shoes and socks were both broken. The shoes blamed the socks, and the socks blamed the shoes. The both of them took their dispute to the deities, but the deities could not resolve it, and so they asked the feet to arbitrate. The feet replied: "I've been hanging out in the open all this while - what would I know?"
鞋襪都該歸咎于脚跟。問何故。曰。都被老脚跟摩壞了。
`The socks and shoes should both blame the feet. When the feet ask why, they reply: "We were both spoiled by the feet's grinding."
一人見破襪者。戱謂曰。你的鞋子在那裡滾。其人［150］不觧。問之曰。襪都抪出來了。
`Someone saw a man with broken socks, and wanted to tease him, saying: "Where did your shoes get rolled about?" The man didn't understand and asked him what he meant. He replied: "Your socks are all scattered about."
＊＊襪
一人襪破無底。跳一水缺。襪從脚面墜下。旁人見之呼曰。老兄轉來。拾了襪去。其人穿襪謝曰。不遇兄這般好人。幾失此襪矣。家中有舊襪一雙。當以相謝。
`**Socks
`Someone's socks were so broken, that when he jumped over a puddle, they slipped off his legs entirely and were left behind. A bystander saw this and called out to him: "Hey brother! You've left your socks behind!" The man thanked him as he put them back on, saying: "Good people like you are hard to find! Thanks to you, I didn't lose my socks. I have an older pair at home; I'd like to give them to you in thanks."
原來無底的是他新襪。可笑。有狎客毡襪太敝。衆欲舉以為笑。乃出令曰。視襪有破孔者。每孔浮一太白。狎客陰貫二襪于股。伸足曰。我今日不曾穿［151］襪出來。
＊＊筆管襪
時興筆管襪。言極窄也。有買襪者。屢易而嫌寛不止。店主曰。公若要如意。何不去尋漆匠。問其故。荅曰。不用穿襪。只白染了兩腿。豈不妙。
＊＊喫着
有曵瓜皮出城者。遇曵破草鞋者于途。問曰。尔將此何用。曵鞋者曰。我以破甚者供燎爨之用。擇其好者［152］穿之。因問汝曵瓜皮何用。曰。你要穿好的。我豈不要喫好的。
末二句。或只云。单許你穿好的麼。亦蘊籍。
＊＊属犬
一酒客訝同席者飲啖太猛。問其年。對以属犬。曰。早是属犬。若属虎。連我也都喫了。
`**Year of the Dog
`A guest at a banquet was alarmed that his neighbor was devouring his food so violently, and asked him what sign he was born under. The neighbor replied that he was born in the year of the dog. The guest said: "That's just as well; if you had been born in the year of the tiger, you would have gobbled me up along with everything else!"
又有道人。願捨身夜餧虫蚊。大士試其誠。化為虎欲啖之。道人大呌曰。別客可請。今晚這東道難做。
又有一人遇餓虎。將遭啖。哀懇之曰。圈有肥猪。願以自代。虎許之。随至其家。喚婦取猪啖虎。婦不舍。曰。所存荳腐頗多。亦堪一飽。其人曰。罷々。看這一箇主客。可是喫素的。
＊＊合卓
甲乙同席。甲大啖。問乙何不動箸。乙曰。小弟想還有一卓。甲曰。弟與兄是合卓的。乙曰。兄也曉得是合卓的麼。［154］

＊＊索燭
有與善啖者同席。見盤中且盡。呼主翁索燭。主翁曰。得無太早乎。曰。我卓上已不見了。
＊＊人禱
一神險惡。賽者必用人禱。有點者穵供卓中一孔。而伸頭其內。俟神舉筯。頭忽縮下。神大怒。罵曰。這般小［155］鬼都是賊。方纔動手。如何嘎飯就沒了。
或問險惡神有名手。余曰。此盡盤將軍也。
＊＊撒網
或見善啖者。頃刻肴盡。復以筯撈取其餘。乃急除網巾擲之。驚問其故。荅曰。你到不如撒一網罷。
＊＊日食

＊＊荳腐
一人留客飯。止荳腐一味。自言荳腐是我性命。覺他味不及有。異日至客家。客記其食性所好。乃于魚肉中各和荳腐。其人擇魚肉大啖。客問曰。兄甞云荳腐是性命。今日如何不喫。荅曰。見了魚肉。性命都不要了。［157］
有好食魚肉者。謂人曰。人生只受用一飽。［死］後惟此腹随我耳。一人曰。我見異汝。即不飯魚肉。［死］後□此腹不随我。余謂好食魚肉者。說此腹随我。甚只随了魚肉走。那裡随你。
＊＊餛飩
甲乙同食餛飩一盂。甲舉筯如飛。乙為停手。須臾噉盡。止留一隻。乙不堪。謂曰。何不并啖此隻。荅云。麵食。［158］
一說妻病。夫問曰。想甚食否。妻曰。除是好肉餛飩想喫一二隻耳。夫為治一盂。意欲與妻同享。方往取筯回。而妻已染指噉盡。止餘其一矣。夫曰。何不并啖此枝。妻攢眉荅云。我若喫得下此隻。就不害病了。
＊＊饅頭
有貧士餒甚。見市有鬻饅頭者。偽大呼仆地。主人驚問其故。曰吾性畏饅頭。主人因設數十枝于空室中。［159］而閉士于內。冀相困以為一笑。久之寂如。乃啟門。見其搏食［過］半。詰之。則曰不知何故。忽不覺畏。主人怒叱曰。汝得無尚有他畏乎。曰無他。此際只畏苦茶兩碗。
＊＊糕
有呌賣糕者。聲甚啞。人問其故。曰。我餓耳。問既餓。何不食糕。曰是餿的。｛｛兩曰皆低声說｝｝
`**Cakes

＊＊糍粑
［160］有啖糍粑過多歸家而嘔者。妻使婢視之。還報曰。有糍粑在地。官人對之而嘔。不知何故。妻曰。得無傷食耶。婢曰。非也。若食而吐者。那得無齒痕。
＊＊慣撞席
鼠與獺結交。鼠先請獺。々荅席。䭾鼠［過］河。置之船旁暫往覔食。猫忽來見鼠。作欲食狀。鼠慌曰。請我的不見。吃我的又來了。
＊＊又
［161］一［鄉］人做廵捕官。值按院門。太守來見。跪報云。太老官人進。按君怒。責之十下。次日。太守來。報云。太公祖進。按君又責之。至苐三日。太守又來。自念［鄉］語不可。通文又不可。乃報云。前日來的。昨日來的。今日又來的了。
余嘗寓南院中。有撞寡門者。屢次相［過］。述此嘲之。一時大笑。又友人方張宴。一俗子至。主人勉留之。席散。主人恠閽人與通。頗加誚讓。次日。其人不待［162］欵啟。直入書室。余述此笑話。而易其末段云。至苐三日。太守又來。乃跪懇之曰。你來一次。連累我一次。勸你今日莫進去罷。一時亦大笑。
＊＊喫素
一鬼見冥王。自陳一生吃素。要求箇好人身。王云。我那裡查考。須剖腹騐之。既剖。但見一肚皮涎唾。
`**Going vegetarian
`A ghost came before the lord of Hell, and justified himself by saying that he had spent his entire mortal life as a vegetarian, and so asked that he be reborn to a good human life. The lord of Hell said: "I'll have to check that you're not lying," and so he ordered that the ghost's belly be cut open. When they did so, they found that all he had in his stomach was saliva. 
至々生云。該罰他做一隻蟹。原吐出來。
佛說輪廻。如簷頭滴水。點々不差。今殺一雞。後世［163］我身。仍變為雞。而為彼殺。乃至百䖝亦復如是或駁之曰。若然。莫如殺虎而食。後世變為虎食人。又後世復變為人而食虎矣。且有知無知。等生也。則等殺也。食鳥變鳥。食魚變魚。尚得暫領飲。啄游沫之趣。若食蘿蔔菜。後世亦應變蘿蔔菜。藏頭土中。時受糞穢。既悶且臭終不免殺。豈不倍苦。此雖強詞奪理。亦由已甚之說激之耳。即如殺人者［死］。法也。然自弑逆以及悞傷。刑不一律。况人物貴賤豈［164］無差等。而概云相償。何以塞老饕之口。禮經云。諸侯無故不殺牛。大夫無故不殺羊。士無故不殺犬豕。則有故而殺者。在議之內矣。即無故不殺。亦分別言之。非㮣禁也。王制戒數罟。孔子釣不網。弋不射宿。這纔是箇中道。近有問袁中郎六齋十齋何說。荅曰。欲生人漸遠殺氣。名言哉。
＊＊又
屠有貪者。聞陰間猪肉得價。盡宰家猪。而自縊。為鬼［165］市。賣至第十八重獄。見門禁甚嚴。私念餘肉。尚多。舍此則無售矣。乃厚賂閽者求入。既入。羣鬼見之。訝曰。汝來差了。此間都是吃素的。
＊＊又
猫項下偶帶數珠。老鼠見之。喜曰。猫喫素矣。率其子孫詣猫言謝。猫大呌一聲。連啖數鼠。老鼠急走。乃脫伸舌曰。他喫素後越兇了。
`**Vegetarian (3)
`A cat began wearing a rosary around its neck. When the mouse saw this, it was glad, saying: "The cat has become a vegetarian!" It led its clan to see the cat and thank it. The cat let out a huge roar, and gobbled up several mice at a go. The old mouse fled in a panic. Panting, it said: "He's gotten fiercer since becoming a vegetarian!"
喫齋念佛。乃上等好事。但世人不求種福。而專求［166］准罪。不惟思准已往之罪。且思預准將來之罪。至今人謂若要欺心人。喫素蜪裡尋。良可恨也。有老翁強奪人產。其子泣諫曰。翁一生好善。何忽作此強橫事耶。翁笑曰。吾奉齋甚久。念佛甚多。所種福業。還勾你一代強橫哩。又有軍士念佛者。主師問曰。臨陣須殺人。如何終日念佛。荅曰。我口中念佛。肚裡一片殺人心。咦。阿彌陀佛。地獄之設。盖謂此軰。［167］
＊＊甘蔗查
一人拾甘蔗查嚼之。恨其枯甚。乃詈曰。真饞牢。吃得這等盡情。
＊＊熟荳
有師徒同遊街上。見熟荳一粒。徒俯拾之。師曰。衆人属日之地。奈何如此。其徒不覺面赤。比歸。悶坐室中。少焉。聞扣門聲甚急。徒問何人。師曰。頃所拾荳。可出共享。難道獨自受用。［168］
舊話云。蒙師見徒手持一餅。誘之曰。我咬箇月彎與你看。既咬一口。又曰。再咬箇錠勝與你看。徒不忍。以手掩之。悞咬其指。乃呵曰。沒事沒事。今日不要你念書了。家中若問時。只云狗咬便罷。
＊＊柿
有鬻乾柿者。一士見之。連取食二杖。又欲舉手。鬻柿者慍曰。相公各要尊重。士復取一杖。且行且頋曰。你不知。此物甚能清肺。［169］
`**Persimmons
`There was a person selling dried persimmons. Seeing this, a scholar took two sticks and ate them one after another. He was about to raise his hand to take another, when the seller of dried persimmons stopped him, saying "my good sir, we should have respect for one another." The scholar took a stick anyway, and as he walked off he looked back to ssy, "you don't know, but these are very good for clearing out the lungs."
鬻柿者宜荅曰。相公的尊肺。也不在我肝上。
`The persimmon-seller should have replied, "sir, your honorable lungs are not above my liver!"
＊＊妻給食
一窮漢婦美。頗有調之者。夫不許。然夫每出覔食。輙竟日不歸。婦因為私交以自給。一日夫歸。呼餓甚。婦曰。前某々願給我朝夕。汝自不肯耳。夫悔恨久之。妻知其意急。因使視鍋中。則有白米飯。及肉在。欣然飽餐。問何從來。妻曰。此即某所遺也。因忍餓不［過］。姑與私通耳。夫喜曰。問此人好男風否。［170］
`**The wife puts food on the table
`A poor man had a beautiful wife, Many took a fancy to her, but he would not allow it. But every day, as he went out to look for food, he would not return until the close of day, so his wife took to sleeping with other men to provide for herself. One day, the husband came home, crying out that he was very hungry. The wife said, "before when so-and-so was willing to give me heaven and earth, you were not willing." The husband was full of regret. His wife knew what was on his mind, and so told him to look in the pot. In there was not just rice, but also meat. Delighted at this full meal, he asked where it came from. The wife replied, "this was left here by that so-and-so. Because I was so hungry that I could not bear it any more, I agreed to sleep with him in return for this." The husband was delighted and said, "could you ask him if he is also into other men?"
＊＊夢戱酌
一人夢赴戱酌。方定席。為妻驚醒。乃罵其妻。々曰。不要罵。趂早睡去。戱文還未到半本哩。
`**Dreaming of a play
`A man dreaamed that he was attending a theatrical production. Just as the show got underway, he was woken up by his wife. He started scolding her, whereupon she said, "don't scold me. If you go back to sleep soon, they will still not be even halfway through the script."
＊＊早赴席
有請客者。嘱以早赴。其人心記。半夜即起。妻止之。四鼓。復起。妻又止之。忽睡去。既醒。則黎明矣。大驚。以為遲也。亟梳洗以往。則夜來客久坐方散。在門外作別。其人遙望。即頓足曰。吾為不賢妻所悞。梁然來遲。席已散矣。
`**Punctual to the banquet
`When making invitations to a banquet, a host told his guests to come early. One of those invited took this to heart. In the middle of the night, he woke up, only to be put back to bed by his wife. At the fourth watch, he woke up again, but his wife again returned him to bed. He fell straight back into sleep, and when he awoke it was already daybreak. Greatly alarmed because he thought he was late, he quickly brushed his hair and washed up and set off to the house of his host. At that time, guests from the night before who had stayed over were just leaving, and standing by the door saying their goodbyes. Seeing this from afar, he stopped in his tracks and said, "if not for that good-for-nothing wife of mine, I wouldn't have come late. Now the banquet is already over!"
＊＊掗相知
有掗相知者。途遇一人。即冒認以為通家。久濶。必欲登堂。辭以道遠不勞。曰小弟北京也常去的。不得已。乃同行。至家呼茶。即曰。不消賜茶酒。主人私念此無賴。不飲酒不止。因呼酒。又曰不消賜酒飯。因又命治飯。々次。見其人四頋不已。問其何。荅曰。我看那一䖏好掛網巾。［172］
`**Hail fellow well met
此舊笑話也。前尚有辭以危橋惡犬語。後尚有殺身難報多語。余惡共煩悉去之。
＊＊［攜］燈
有夜飲者。僕［攜］燈往候其主。々曰。少時便天明矣。何用燈為。僕乃歸。至天明。復往。主訝曰。汝大不曉事。今日反不帶燈來。
`**Bringing a lantern
`A man was drinking into the night. One of his servants carried a lantern when he came to attend to him, but the master said: "It's going to be daybreak soon, why are you bothering with a lantern?" The servant went away. When the sun came up, the servant returned. The master was surprised, and said: "You really have no common sense - today you don't bring a lantern." [?]
吳俗賣小菜傭。率以五鼓出行。適臨街樓中有通宵飲者。菜傭見而訝之。曰。知此早便飲酒乎。飲者［173］亦訝菜傭曰。如此晏尚賣菜乎。此事可發一笑。乃知長夜失日。真有是事。
＊＊遠近
衆客酒後各談。歸途遠近。一醉客曰。合席惟我最近。衆云莫如主人。醉客矓目云。主人進去。尚有少路。我只此已是了。
`**Not far off
`The guests at a banquet were discussing how far they had to travel to go home. One drunk guest said, "of everyone here, I have the shortest distance to travel. The others said, "shouldn't that be our host?" With bleary eyes, the drunk replied, "when he retires for the night, he still has a few steps to take. But I, well, I'm already here!"
＊＊淡酒
有以淡水酒飲客者。客甞之。極譽其烹庖之妙。主人［174］曰。粗殽尚未設。何以知之。荅曰。勿論其他。只這一味酒煮白滾湯。已好喫矣。
`**Diluted wine
`At a dinner, the host secretly added water to dilute the wine that he served to his guests. Before the meal began, one of the guests remarked: "The soup you've prepared for us tonight is excellent!" The host said: "But the dishes haven't been served yet - how could you possibly know what it tastes like?" The guest replied: "It doesn't matter what the other dishes are like, but this clear broth spiced with a dash of wine is very tasty."

`**Diluted wine (2)
`A guest found that he had been served a pot of diluted wine, and asked his host for a knife. The host asked: "Why do you need a knife?" He replied: "To stab this pot." "Why would you want to stab the pot?" "To let out some of the moisture."
一說見淡酒至。便縮脚置椅上。人問其故。曰。水至矣。又舊話。●＝左魚右兵＝魚與河魨扳親。●＝左魚右兵＝魚屢往備擾海錯。因語河魨親家何不到小去䖏下頋。河魨［175］許馬。●＝左魚右兵＝魚歸曰。海頭太々至矣。擇深港迎之。魨魚甫至港口。便返。●＝左魚右兵＝官追問其故。曰。我喫不慣貴䖏這樣淡水。

`**Diluted wine (3)
`A man enjoyed the taste of some wine so much that he asked for the recipe, He was told to use so much grain, so much yeast, so much water, and to ferment it for so many days, and to open it for so many days. He noted everything down, but when the time came he found that he only had water, and so went back to complain. The other person asked him if he had deviated from the recipe. He replied, "I would never. I used so much yeast, so much water, fermented it for so long, opened it after so many days, and because I wanted the fragrance I also added some stalks of chrysanthemum flowers." "What about the grain?" "That was the only thing I forgot."
＊＊酸酒

The proprietor explained: "My shop sells good wine. But this man complained that it was sour, and so deserved to be hung up in the ceiling." The new guest said: "Why don't you give me a glass so I can taste it for myself." After he had tried it, he sorrowfully told the proprietor: "You can let that man go, and hang me up there instead."

`**Soured wine (2)
`There was a shop that sold soured wine. A customer came to the shop, and told the proprietor: "Just tofu and vegetables will do, but I need to have good wine to go with it." The proprietor nodded and went to the back. A while later he returned to ask: "Do you mind some vinegar in your vegetables?" The customer said: "Vegetable hearts cooked with a touch of vinegar are excellent." When they arrived at the table he ate everything up. Again the proprietor asked: "Do you mind some vinegar in your tofu?" The customer said: "Tofu steamed with vinegar sauce is delicious." And he ate it all when it arrived. Again the proprietor asked: "Do you mind some vinegar in your wine?" The customer was shocked: "Why would you want to add vinegar to wine?" The proprietor frowned and said: "Well I can't help it now, I've already added it."

The shopkeeper said, "a xiucai scholar official had just said that this wine was like him, and of course that means it is sour. But you say that it is like you, what does that mean?" The woman replied, "nothing special, just that it is somewhat out of sorts."
＊＊借茶葉
有留客飲茶者。向鄰家借茶葉。未至。每湯沸。以水益之。釜且滿矣。而茶葉終不得。妻乃謂夫曰。此友是相知的。到留他洗箇浴去罷。

Eventually he came back empty handed. His wife then told him, "since your friends all know each other, why not ask them if they would like to take a hot bath instead?"
＊＊何魨
有夫婦聞河魨甚盛。謀買甞之。既治具。疑其味毒。互［179］相推諉。久之。妻不得已。將先舉筯。乃含淚謂夫曰。喫是我先喫了。只求你看頋這兩箇兒女。
`**Pufferfish
`A married couple heard that pufferfish were really tasty, and so bought some to try. But after it was prepared, they were worried that it might be still poisonous, and so each started pushing the responsibility on the other. After some time, the wife felt that she had no other choice, and picked up her chopsticks first. With tears in her eyes she told her husband: "I will go ahead and take the first bite. I just beg you to look after our two children."
