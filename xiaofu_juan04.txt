＊＊方術部
墨憨子曰。{nn/孔/nn}{nn/墨/nn}之後。儒分為八。墨離為三。白再踰而成黑。雖小道。必有可笑者焉。集方術部。
`**Diverse occupations
`Mohanzi says: After the time of Confucius and Mozi, the Confucians split into eight schools, while the Mohians split into three. White has shaded into black. Although these are minor occupations, there is still much worth laughing about. The chapter on diverse occupations follows...
``A reference to the Analects, Zi Zhang 4: {nn/子夏/nn}曰：「雖小道，必有可觀者焉；致遠恐泥，是以君子不為也。」 - Zi Xia said, "Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable. Therefore, the superior man does not practice them." (Legge translation)
＊＊醫人

＊＊幼科
［108］富家延二醫。一大方。一幼科。適客至。問一位何人。主人荅曰。皆名醫。又問那一科。主人指曰。這是大方。這是小兒。
舊話呂洞賔戯白牡丹。白問其陽何物。荅曰。仙人種也。呂亦問其陰。荅曰。小兒窠。
＊＊夜啼
小兒苦夜啼。迎醫治之。醫用藥訖。因留宿。夜半。使童子潜探兒啼止否。還報曰。兒不啼。兒母啼矣。
`**Bawling at night
`A baby was bawling through the night, and so a physician was invited to treat it. The physician fed it medicine, and stayed over for the night. At midnight, he sent an errand-boy to check if the baby had stopped bawling. He came back to report: "The baby is not bawling, but its mother is."
一說還報云。小兒不啼。大人啼矣。醫曰。問大人也要藥吃否。
`Another version says, that he came back to report that the baby was not bawling, but the master of the household was. The doctor said: "Ask the master if he would also like to have some medicine."
＊＊身𤍠

`**Fever
`A child fell ill with fever, and died after receiving medicine. His father accused the physician of failing to do his duty. The physician did not believe this, and came himself to check. On touching the child's body, he turned to the father and said: "You're spreading lies; the fever's gone!"
`This is the same sort of person who uses a vise to cure a hunchback. One doesn't need to be told that's a joke, but the old way of treating illness, only treating the head when there's a headache and only treating the foot when there's a footache, is cut from the same cloth.
＊＊藥闘
［110］病兒服藥後。腹痛甚。兒父走問醫者。醫者曰。無訪此。吾藥與病鬦耳。言未畢。家人跟蹌而至。報兒［死］矣。醫拊掌曰。我說鬦我的藥不［過］。
`**Fighting medicine
`A sick child was given some medicine, but his belly started hurting very much. The child's father went to ask the physician, and the physician said: "Don't ask any more, it's just the medicine fighting the illness." But before he could finish speaking, a family member came running up to report that the child had died. The physician clapped his hands and said: "I told you that my medicine can't be beaten in a fight!"

`**A decent burial
`A physician killed somebody's child with his medicine. The child's family abuses him, and told him, "if you take away my child's body for burial, we shall not pursue the matter further." The physician agreed, and took the body with him as he went off, packing it into one of his medicine cases. On the road, he encountered yet another patient. Reaching into a case for medicine, he accidentally revealed the dead child's corpse. The patient was shocked, and asked for an explanation. He explained, "I'm taking this one off to be revived."
＊＊又
有醫［死］人兒。許以袖回殯殮者。其家恐見欺。命僕随之。至橋中。忽取［死］兒擲諸河。僕怒曰。如何拋了我家小舍。醫曰。非也。因舉左袖曰。汝家的自在。
`**A decent burial (2)
`A physician killed a child by his malpractice, and agreed to take the corpse off for a burial, carrying it in his sleeve. The dead child's family was afraid that he would trick them, and so ordered a servant to follow him. When he came to a bridge, he suddenly tossed the corpse into the river. The servant was furious, saying, "why did you toss away my young master?" The physician replied, "I did not." He raised his left sleeve, and said, "your young master is in this sleeve."
＊＊學游水

`**Learning to swim
`A physician had killed one of his patients, and was tied up by the late patient's family. He managed to loose himself at night, and escaped back to his home by hiding in water. He saw his son who was just reading about the pulse in medicine, and suddenly said to him, "my boy, reading of books can wait. What's more urgent is that you learn how to swim."
＊＊冥王訪名醫
冥王遣冥卒訪陽間名醫。命之曰。門前無寃鬼者即是。每［過］醫門。寃鬼畢集。最後至一家。見門前獨鬼徬徨。曰。此可當名醫矣。問之。乃昨日新竪藥牌者。
`**Hades seeks a good physician
`Hades despatched his minions to seek out a good physician in the world of the living, telling them: "You will know when you come to a good physician because he will have no aggrieved spirits hanging around his door." But at every physician's doorway, the minions of Hades found plenty of aggrieved spirits. Finally they came to one physician's house where there was only one aggrieved spirit walking to and fro in front of it. They said to each other: "This must be finally the good physician!" But when they asked, it turned out that he had only started his practice yesterday.
＊＊賠
一醫。々［死］人兒。即以己兒賠之。無何。醫死人僕。家止一僕。入以賠之。一夜又有叩門者。云娘々產裡病。煩看。醫私謂妻曰。又看中意你了。［113］
`**Compensation
`A physician, who killed someone's child when treating it, compensated him with his own child. Soon afterward, he killed someone's servant, and offered up a servant from his own household as compensation. One evening, yet another came knocking on his door, saying: "My mistress at home is sick, please come and see her." The physician whispered to his wife: "Looks like someone is interested in you."
＊＊殭蚕
一醫甚無生理。忽求藥者至。開箱取藥。中多蛀虫。人問此何物。曰殭蚕。又問殭蚕如何是活的。曰。喫我藥耳。
只怕人喫了。倒做了殭蚕。
`**Silkworm larvae
`A physician had no business for a long time, when he finally had a patient who needed medicine. When he opened his medicine chest, it was full of bookworms. The patient asked him what they were, and he replied that they were silkworm larvae (jiangcan, dried larvae used in traditional Chinese medicine). The patient asked again, how is it that they are alive? The physician replied: because they ate some of my medicine.
`One fears that if humans eat it, they would become silkworm larvae.

`A physician moved house, and called on his new neighbors, saying: "I have been bothering you all lately, but haven't yet brought anything as a greeting gift. Here is a gift of medicine for everybody." The neighbor protested that there was nothing wrong with him, and the physician replied: "Once you eat my medicine, there will definitely be something wrong." 
＊＊罵
病家請醫看。醫許以無事。費多金。竟不起。病家恨甚。遣僕往罵之。頃間便回。問曾罵否。曰。不曾。問何以不罵。曰。罵者太多。教我如何擠得上。［116］
`**Scolding
`A sick person called for a physician. The physician said that everything would be fine, but even after spending a lot of money, he was still not better. He was very angry and sent his servant to go berate the physician. In a short while, the servant was back. When asked if he had scolded the physician, he said no. "Why not?" asked the master. The servant replied: "There were too many people there who wanted to scold him. I couldn't squeeze my way through."

`**Lice medicine
`Someone put up a sign to advertise his medicine for killing lice. When asked how to use the medicine, he said: "First you catch the louse, then smear the medicine on its mouth until it dies."

In the morning, the householder came for his dose of medicine, and happened to pick out that very bottle. The physician stopped him, and the householder asked what medicine that was. The physician replied: "That's some tonic medicine for my own use."
有謂小便為還魂湯。服之益人。然則此乃還魂飯也。名為補藥宜矣。
`Some call urine "soul-restoring soup", and use it as a stimulant. If that's the case, then there should likewise be a "soul-restoring rice" that would be easy to sell as a tonic medicine.

Puzzled about how this happened, the son went to the temple of the town god, and asked the spirits for guidance. When he slept, the deity came to him in his dreams. He asked: "What was the reason for my unexpected success?" The spirit replied: "Your father has great hidden powers." He said: "My father is a physician.

`**Third Brother
`During the Han period, a famous physiognomist came to visit Liu Bei. Liu allowed him to read his fortune from his features, and the physiognomist said: "Your features are very fine. Your face is fair and so is your heart." He then went to read the face of Guan Yu, and told him: "Your features are exceedingly fine. A ruddy face and a ruddy heart." Liu heard this, and rushed to see Zhang Fei. Taking his hand, he said: "Third Brother - your face is not your fate, is it?" (Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei famously swore brotherhood in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Guan Yu is usually depicted with a reddish complexion, and Zhang Fei with a black one.)
