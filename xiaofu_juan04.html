<div class="translation"><h1>Chapter 4</h1></div>
<h2 id="h2_0">方術部<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>墨憨子曰。<span class="nn" id="nn_0">孔</span><span class="nn" id="nn_1">墨</span>之後。儒分為八。墨離為三。白再踰而成黑。雖小道。必有可笑者焉。集方術部。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Diverse occupations</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>Mohanzi says: After the time of Confucius and Mozi, the Confucians split into eight schools, while the Mohians split into three. White has shaded into black. Although these are minor occupations, there is still much worth laughing about (a reference to the Analects, Zi Zhang 4: 子夏曰：「雖小道，必有可觀者焉；致遠恐泥，是以君子不為也。). The chapter on diverse occupations follows...</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_1">醫人<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有遇醫士出門者。犬適欄門而吠。主人喝之即止。醫贊其觧人意。主人曰。此畜生頗々依<span class="smallerText">醫</span>人。</p>
<h2 id="h2_2">幼科<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［108］富家延二醫。一大方。一幼科。適客至。問一位何人。主人荅曰。皆名醫。又問那一科。主人指曰。這是大方。這是小兒。</p>
<p>舊話呂洞賔戯白牡丹。白問其陽何物。荅曰。仙人種也。呂亦問其陰。荅曰。小兒窠。</p>
<h2 id="h2_3">夜啼<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>小兒苦夜啼。迎醫治之。醫用藥訖。因留宿。夜半。使童子潜探兒啼止否。還報曰。兒不啼。兒母啼矣。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Bawling at night</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A baby was bawling through the night, and so a physician was invited to treat it. The physician fed it medicine, and stayed over for the night. At midnight, he sent an errand-boy to check if the baby had stopped bawling. He came back to report: "The baby is not bawling, but its mother is."</p></div>
<p>一說還報云。小兒不啼。大人啼矣。醫曰。問大人也要藥吃否。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>Another version says, that he came back to report that the baby was not bawling, but the master of the household was. The doctor said: "Ask the master if he would also like to have some medicine."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_4">身𤍠<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>小兒患身熱。服藥而［死］。其父詣醫家咎之。醫不信。自往騐視。撫兒尸。謂其父曰。你太欺心。身子幸已凉矣。</p>
<p>此與醫駝背用夹板者同。人但知此是笑話。不知執古方治病。頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚者。皆此類也。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Fever</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A child fell ill with fever, and died after receiving medicine. His father accused the physician of failing to do his duty. The physician did not believe this, and came himself to check. On touching the child's body, he turned to the father and said: "You're spreading lies; the fever's gone!"</p></div>
<p>This is the same sort of person who uses a vise to cure a hunchback。 One doesn't need to be told that's a joke， but the old way of treating illness， only treating the head when there's a headache and only treating the foot when there's a footache， is cut from the same cloth。</p>
<h2 id="h2_5">藥闘<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>［110］病兒服藥後。腹痛甚。兒父走問醫者。醫者曰。無訪此。吾藥與病鬦耳。言未畢。家人跟蹌而至。報兒［死］矣。醫拊掌曰。我說鬦我的藥不［過］。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Fighting medicine</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A sick child was given some medicine, but his belly started hurting very much. The child's father went to ask the physician, and the physician said: "Don't ask any more, it's just the medicine fighting the illness." But before he could finish speaking, a family member came running up to report that the child had died. The physician clapped his hands and said: "I told you that my medicine can't be beaten in a fight!"</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_6">包●＝左『歹』右『賔』＝殮<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一幼醫藥［死］人兒。々家詬之曰。汝若好々●＝左『歹』右『賔』＝殮我兒。我無言矣。醫許。以帶歸䖏置。因約兒于藥箱中。々途又遇一病家邀去。啟箱用藥。誤露［死］兒。病家驚問。對曰。這是我帶去包活的。［111］</p>
<h2 id="h2_7">又<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有醫［死］人兒。許以袖回●＝左『歹』右『賔』＝殮者。其家恐見欺。命僕随之。至橋中。忽取［死］兒擲諸河。僕怒曰。如何拋了我家小舍。醫曰。非也。因舉左袖曰。汝家的自在。</p>
<h2 id="h2_8">學游水<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一醫生醫壞人。為喪家所縛。夜自脫。赴水遁歸。見其子方讀。脉訣。遽謂曰。我兒。讀書尚緩還是學游水要緊。［112］</p>
<h2 id="h2_9">冥王訪名醫<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>冥王遣冥卒訪陽間名醫。命之曰。門前無寃鬼者即是。每［過］醫門。寃鬼畢集。最後至一家。見門前獨鬼徬徨。曰。此可當名醫矣。問之。乃昨日新竪藥牌者。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Hades seeks a good physician</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>Hades despatched his minions to seek out a good physician in the world of the living, telling them: "You will know when you come to a good physician because he will have no aggrieved spirits hanging around his door." But at every physician's doorway, the minions of Hades found plenty of aggrieved spirits. Finally they came to one physician's house where there was only one aggrieved spirit walking to and fro in front of it. They said to each other: "This must be finally the good physician!" But when they asked, it turned out that he had only started his practice yesterday.</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_10">賠<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一醫。々［死］人兒。即以己兒賠之。無何。醫死人僕。家止一僕。入以賠之。一夜又有叩門者。云娘々產裡病。煩看。醫私謂妻曰。又看中意你了。［113］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Compensation</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A physician, who killed someone's child when treating it, compensated him with his own child. Soon afterward, he killed someone's servant, and offered up a servant from his own household as compensation. One evening, yet another came knocking on his door, saying: "My mistress at home is sick, please come and see her." The physician whispered to his wife: "Looks like someone is interested in you."</p></div>
<h2 id="h2_11">殭蚕<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一醫甚無生理。忽求藥者至。開箱取藥。中多蛀虫。人問此何物。曰殭蚕。又問殭蚕如何是活的。曰。喫我藥耳。</p>
<p>只怕人喫了。倒做了殭蚕。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Silkworm larvae</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A physician had no business for a long time, when he finally had a patient who needed medicine. When he opened his medicine chest, it was full of bookworms. The patient asked him what they were, and he replied that they were silkworm larvae (jiangcan, dried larvae used in traditional Chinese medicine). The patient asked again, how is it that they are alive? The physician replied: because they ate some of my medicine.</p></div>
<p>One fears that if humans eat it， they would become silkworm larvae。</p>
<h2 id="h2_12">怨算命<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>或見醫者。問以生意如何。荅曰。不要說起。都被算命先生悞了。嘱我有病人家莫走。［114］</p>
<h2 id="h2_13">自飲<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一醫賣生熟藥。俱不發市。乃煎成藥飲賣之。至夜。無來問者。恨曰。這等沒生意。活他做甚便取所煎藥自飲。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Self-medication</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A medicine peddler was selling fresh herbs, but no customers came calling, so he boiled them up to make a herbal brew to sell. Night came and still no customers came. In a fit of despair, he said: "There's no business to be had here, what's the point in living?" And so he took his herbal brew and drank it all down himself. </p></div>
<h2 id="h2_14">看脉<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>有醫壞人者。罰牽麥十擔。牽畢。放歸。明日有叩門者曰。請先生看脉。<span class="smallerText">麥</span>醫應曰。曉得了。先淘在那裡。我就來牽也。［115］</p>
<h2 id="h2_15">送藥<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>一醫遷居。謂鄰舍曰。向來打攪。無物可將別敬。每位奉藥一帖。鄰舍辭以無病。醫曰。喫我藥起來。自然有病。</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Gift of medicine</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A physician moved house, and called on his new neighbors, saying: "I have been bothering you all lately, but haven't yet brought anything as a greeting gift. Here is a gift of medicine for everybody." The neighbor protested that there was nothing wrong with him, and the physician replied: "Once you eat my medicine, there will definitely be something wrong." </p></div>
<h2 id="h2_16">罵<a class="superscript" href="#h1_0">^</a></h2>
<p>病家請醫看。醫許以無事。費多金。竟不起。病家恨甚。遣僕往罵之。頃間便回。問曾罵否。曰。不曾。問何以不罵。曰。罵者太多。教我如何擠得上。［116］</p>
<div class="translation"><h2>Scolding</h2></div>
<div class="translation"><p>A sick person called for a physician. The physician said that everything would be fine, but even after spending a lot of money, he was still not better. He was very angry and sent his servant to go berate the physician. In a short while, the servant was back. When asked if he had scolded the physician, he said no. "Why not?" asked the master. The servant replied: "There were too many people there who wanted to scold him. I couldn't squeeze my way through."</p></div>

He then went to read the face of Guan Yu, and told him: "Your features are exceedingly fine. A ruddy face and a ruddy heart." Liu heard this, and rushed to see Zhang Fei. Taking his hand, he said: "Third Brother - your face is not your fate, is it?" (Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei famously swore brotherhood in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
