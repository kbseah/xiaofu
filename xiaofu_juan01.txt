＊笑府序
`*Preface
古今來莫非話也。話莫非笑也。兩儀之混沌開闢。列聖之揖譲征誅。見者其誰耶。夫亦話之而已耳。後之話今亦猶今之話昔。話之而疑［2］之可笑也。話之而信之尤可笑也。經書子史鬼話也。而爭傳焉。詩賦文章淡話也。而爭工焉。褒譏伸抑亂話也。而爭趋避焉。或笑人或笑於人。笑人者亦復笑于［3］人。笑●人者亦復笑人。之相笑寧有己時。笑府集笑話也。十三萹猶曰簿乎云爾。或閱之而喜。請勿喜。或閱之而嗔。請勿嗔。古今世界一大笑府。我與若皆在其中。［4］供人話柄。不話不成人。不笑不成話。不笑不話不成世界。布袋和尚吾師乎。吾師乎。
`From ancient times to the present day, there is nothing that cannot be spoken of, and no speech that cannot be the subject of humor. That Heaven and Earth were made from formless chaos, that past rulers ruled and fought, who among us has borne witness? We have only words to tell us about them. Words from the past are just like words in the present. It is laughable to be always suspicious of them, but it is yet more laughable to be completely trusting of them. The books of the classics, the philosophers, and the histories are just perverse talk, yet we strive to teach and transmit them. Poetry, odes, and essays are just idle talk, yet we strive to perfect them. To extend or to withhold praise and criticism is just nonsense, yet we strain to avoid it. Whether laughing at people or being laughed at by people, the one who laughs will be laughed at by others, while the one being laughed at will laugh at others in turn. When will the laughter ever stop? 
`The Storehouse of Laughter is a collection of humor. These thirteen chapters do not amount to very much. If the reader is gladdened by this book - please don't be gladdened. If the reader is angered by this book - please don't be angered. The world through the ages has been but one great storehouse of laughter. You and I are all in it together. It is offered up here as something to talk about. Not to speak is to be inhuman, not to laugh is not to speak. The world would not be formed without laughter or speech. The Laughing Buddha is my teacher, he is my teacher indeed!

`*Chapter 1
＊＊古艷部
`**Ancient treasures
墨憨子曰。古艷云者。言從古所艷羨也。粟紅貫朽。乘堅策肥。人亦孰不欲富貴哉。所以 䖏富貴者。毋為人笑難耳。昔某翁有三子。翁且［死］。命之言志。伯曰。願堆金百萬。仲曰。願歷官台鼎。季曰。願生大眼一雙。翁訝之。季曰。我須大着眼。看他富貴能幾時鳴呼。慶弔同門。如之何不自警也。集古艷部。［8］
`The Master of Mo-han Studio says: Ancient treasures refer to those things that have been the subject of admiration since days of old. In times of plenty, grain is allowed to molder in the store-house and thread is allowed to rot, while men ride sturdy carriages and whip fat horses. What person doesn't want riches? Those who dwell in riches can hardly avoid being the subject of laughter. 
`There was an old man who had three sons. As he was nearing death, he asked them what they aspired to do. The eldest said: I want fortune - a heap of a million gold pieces. The middle son said: I want to be an official - one of the great officers of state. The youngest son said: I want a pair of big eyes. The father was surprised and asked why. The son replied: I need a big pair of eyes, to see how long their riches can last. 
`Fortune and tragedy are disciples of the same master. Who will not take heed of this warning? Here begins the chapter on Ancient Treasures.
＊＊富翁帶巾
`**Rich man's cap
財主命牧童晒巾。童晒之牛角上。牛臨水照視驚而走逸。童問人曰。見一隻戴巾牛否。
`A rich man instructed a cowherd to dry his cap (typically only worn by scholars) in the sun. The cowherd put it on the horns of his cow to dry. The cow came to the water, saw its own reflection, and fled in shock. The cowherd went around asking: "Has anyone seen a cow wearing a cap?"
此牛自知分量勝却主翁多許。
＊＊借牛
`**Borrowing a cow
有走柬借牛于富翁者。富翁方對客。諱不識字。偽啟緘視之。對來使曰。知道了。少停我自來也。
`Someone sent a letter to a rich man, asking to borrow a cow from him. When the letter came, the rich man was with a guest, and didn't want to reveal that he was illiterate. And so he opened the letter, pretended to read it, and said to the messenger: "Everything is well, in a moment I will come in person." 
雖不識字。却已暗合。［9］
`Despite being illiterate, he was of the same opinion.
余所識一富翁。向人索債。倒持契書。其人笑之，翁怒曰。吾持與汝看。豈自看耶。又方對客。適鄰家致柬。翁展視客知其貿々。故問之。翁曰。請我吃酒耳。使者曰。非也。乃告借銅［鑼］銅鼓一用。翁笑曰。借銅［鑼］銅鼓，難道不請我吃酒。人更服其機敏。
`There was a rich man who went to seek repayment of a debt, but he held the contract upside-down. The debtor laughed at him, and the rich man was furious, saying: "I'm holding this up for you to read! Why would I need to read it?" Another version: A rich man was with a guest, when the neighboring household sent a letter. The rich man opened it to take a look. The guest asked him what the letter was about. The host replied: "It's an invitation go drink some wine with them." The messenger said: "Actually it's not. My master would like to borrow your brass gongs and drums for use." The rich man laughed and said: "If he wants to borrow my brass instruments, wouldn't he have to treat me to a drink?" One has to admire his quick thinking.
＊＊麟
`**Unicorn
{nn/孔子/nn}見［死］麟。哭之不置。弟子謀所以慰之者。乃編錢掛牛體。告孔子曰。麟已活矣。孔子觀之。曰非也。分明［10］一隻牛。只多這幾箇錢耳。
`Confucius saw a dead unicorn and could not stop crying. His disciples debated how to console him, and decided to tie coins to a cow. They showed it to Confucius and said: "Look, the unicorn is still alive!" Confucius saw it, and said: "That's not a unicorn; it's just a cow with a bit of money." 
有姓李者。暴富而驕。或嘲之云。一童子讀百家姓首句。求師請解。師云。趙。是精趙的趙字。｛｛蘇語謂放肆曰趙｝｝錢。是有銅錢的錢字。孫。是小猢猻的孫字。李。是張三李四的李字。又問倒轉可講得否。師曰。也得。童曰。如何講。師曰。姓李的小猢猻。有了幾箇銅錢就精趙起來。

＊＊江心賊
`**The Jiangxin Bandit
［11］一暴富人日夜憂賊。一日偕友遊{gg/江心寺/gg}。壁間題江心賦錯認賦字為賊。驚欲走匿。友問故。答云。江心賊在此。友曰。賦也。非賊也。曰。賦便賦了。終是有此賊形。
`A newly-rich man was worried day and night about bandits. One day he went with his friends to the Jiangxin Temple (in Wenzhou). On the wall was a placard saying "Jiangxin Endowment", but he misread the word "endowment" (fu) as "bandit" (zei - the characters look similar). Shocked, he wanted to run away and hide. His friends asked him what was the matter, and he said: "The Jiangxin Bandit is here!" His friends saw the error, and said: "That's not 'bandit' but 'endowment'/'tax'." "An endowment comes from a tax, and ultimately still has the element of banditry." #wordplay #rework
＊＊清福
`**Carefree life
一鬼托生時。{nn/㝠王/nn}判作富人。鬼曰。不願富也。但願一生衣食不缺。無是無非。燒香吃苦茶過日。足矣。王曰。要銀子便再與你幾萬。這清福許你享。
`A ghost was waiting to be reborn, and the Lord of Hell decided that he be reborn as a rich person. The ghost said: "I don't want much riches; all I wish for is a life where I have clothes on my back and food on the table, where I don't have many responsibilities, but can spend my days burning incense and drinking bitter tea. That would be enough for me." The Lord of Hell said: "If you want silver I can give you a few ten thousand taels more, so that you can enjoy such a carefree life." 
一說鬼云々。王降座問曰。有這等安間受用的所［12］在千萬挈帶我去。
`Another version says that after the ghost had spoken, the Lord of Hell himself came down from his dais, and said: "If there is such an existence to be had, please bring me with you!"
＊＊訓子
`**Teaching the son
一富翁世不識字。人勸以延師訓子。師至。始訓之執筆臨朱。書一畫。則訓曰一字。二畫。則訓曰二字。三畫。則訓曰三字。其子便欣然投筆。告父曰。鬼已都曉字義。何頻師為。乃謝去之。踰時。父擬招所親萬姓者飲令子晨起。治狀。久之不成。父趣之。其子恚曰。姓亦多矣。奈何偏姓萬。自朝至今。［終］完得五百餘畫。
`A rich man was illiterate, and people persuaded him to hire a teacher to teach his son. The teacher came and started by teaching him how to hold the brush. He drew one stroke, and said "this is the number one." (一) Two strokes, "the number two." (二) Three strokes, "the number three." (三) The son then joyously tossed aside the brush, and told his father: "Even ghosts can learn how to write. I don't need a teacher any more." And so the teacher was dismissed. Soon afterwards, the father wanted to invite a relative named Wan ("thousand") to a banquet. He told his son to rise early and prepare the invitation, but after a long while it was still not ready. The father asked what was going on, and the son despairingly replied: "Of all the names to choose, why be called Thousand? From dawn till now, I've only managed Five Hundred."
又有問薑字如何寫者。對以草字頭。次一字。次田字。又一字。又田字。又一字。其人寫草壹田壹田壹完。玩之。罵曰。如何誑我。有此字。分明是一座寶塔兒。
`Yet another person asked how to write the character "jiang" (ginger). The reply came: First the grass radical, then the number one, then the character for field, another one, another field and then the number one. The person wrote Grassnumberonefieldnumberonefieldnumberone. He looked at it and angrily said: "Why mock me like this? This isn't a character, it's a tower!"
＊＊監生打釘
`**The graduate goes for a nailing
一人往妓館打釘畢。徑出。妓牽之索謝。答曰。我生員。妓曰。監生又如何。曰只是白丁。［14］
`A man went to a brothel for a nailing. After he was done and about to leave, the prostitute held on to him seeking a goodbye. He said: "I'm just a shengyuan graduate." The prostitute said: "Even if you're a jiansheng graduate, so what?" He replied: "I'm just a pointless nailing (bai ding - either "pointless nailing" or lit. "blank nail", referring to an ignorant person). 
`#wordplay: "白丁指不學無術或缺乏知識的人"
＊＊考
`**Examination
一監生過{gg/國學/gg}門聞祭酒方。盛怒兩生而治之。問門者曰。然則罰與。打與。礅鎻與。答以出題考文。即咈然曰。咦。罪不之此。
`A jiansheng graduate was walking past the national college when he smelled wine and drunkenness. In a fury he went up to the gate and told the people there: "You deserve to be punished for such disrespect! Should we flog you? Or put you in stocks?" The reply: "We could answer an examination question as a punishment." "Sigh.... your sin is not quite so severe." 
＊＊出塲
`Stepping out 
監生方出塲。遇一故人。故人揖之。并揖路旁猪糞。生問。此臭物。揖之何謂。答曰。他臭便臭。也是膓｛｛塲｝｝裡出來的。［15］
`A jiansheng scholar had just stepped out of the examination hall (chang) when he met someone he knew. The acquaintance greeted him with a bow, and then likewise made a greeting to a pile of pig shit by the road. The scholar asked, "why did you greet that smelly thing?" He replied, "be it smelly as it is, it also has emerged from a chang (intestines)."
`#wordplay
＊＊眷制生
一監生見有投眷制生帖者。深嘆制字新奇。偶致一遠扎。即效之甚得意。僕致書回。生問主人何言。僕曰。當面啟看。便問老相公無恙乎。予對曰安。又問老妳妳無恙乎。予又曰安。乃沉吟數四。帶笑而入。少焉打發回書。遣我歸耳。生大喜曰。人不可不學。只一字用得好。他見了。便添下多少慇勤。
張幼于先生。曾言凡喪服長短。皆王制也。一切㫷［16］功皆可用制字。不獨親喪為然。近亦頗有寫㫷制者。只問老相公老妳々。反是他差。
＊＊王監生
一監生姓王。加納知縣。初視學。青衿呈書得牽牛章請誦之際。忽問那王見之是何人。答曰。此王誦之々兄也。又問那王曰然是何人。答曰。此王曰叟之弟也。曰。好々。且喜我王氏一門都在書上。
或曰。知縣可加納乎。余曰。有詩為證。詩云。加納為［17］官一樣強。不聞臭氣只聞香。若還閣老容交易。破了家私也不妨。
＊＊酸臭
`**Smelly and sour
小虎謂老虎曰。今日吃一箇人。滋味甚異。上半酸。下半臭。是何人也。老虎曰。此必秀才納粟者。
`A small tiger asked a big tiger, "today I ate a person, but he tasted very strange. The upper half was sour, and the lower half smelly. What kind of person was this?" The big tiger replied, "that must have been a xiucai scholar who just received an official position."
近來監生行事。都兼帶酸氣只合喚作𨞑醋耳。｛｛𨞑音甕｝｝
又一秀才畏考。援例。堂試日。至晚不成篇。乃大書卷面曰。惟其如此。所以如此。若要如此。何必如此。［18］堂官見之笑曰。寫得出此四句。畢竟還是箇附例。
`There was a xiucai scholar who was terrified of exams, and so relied on cribs. In the examination hall, he was lost for words well into the night, and wrote in big characters on the script, "only because something, is it therefore something. If we desire that something, then why do something." The exam official saw this laughed saying, "if he could write these four sentences, it is undeniably a pretty good crib."
＊＊官府生日
`**The official's birthday
一官府生辰。吏曹聞其属鼠。醵黃金鑄一鼠為壽。官喜曰。汝知奶々生辰。亦在日下乎。奶々是属牛的。
`On the birthday of an official, his staff, having found out that he was born in the year of the mouse, pooled money to cast a golden mouse for him as a present. When he received it, he gleefully said, "when you know my wife's horoscope sign, you should do the same for her. She was born in the year of the cow."
鴇家哄人。慣以做生日為名。這牛奶々有鴇腔矣余又開一酒今。除眞盜外。要似盜者。一人曰歛錢為首開天窓。一人曰三櫓飛船戴歹人又一人曰。四人憍見唱道來。衆譁曰。此何以似盜。答曰。你看［19］如今樭在轎上的。那箇不勝似強盜。
＊＊應夢
一官性貪。見皂隸髸插一錢欲取無計。乃詐為夢語曰。一箇錢也是好的。既醒。召隸至近。問曰。適我夢中有何言。隸以實對。官乃取其髸邊之錢。叩齒曰。應夢大吉。
＊＊土地
`The earth deity
一官貪甚。任滿。歸家。見家属中多一老叟。問何人。父［20］曰。縣{nn/土地/nn}也。問何為來此。答曰。地皮都被你括將來了。教我如何不随來。
`A greedy official had finished his tour of duty and returned to his native place, where he found an old man sitting in his home. He asked him who he was, to which the old man replied that he was the local earth deity of the district where the official had served. When asked why he had come here, the deity replied, "you've gouged out everything you could including the skin of the earth, so how could I not follow along?"
＊＊青白
一青白人涉訟。自訴眼瞎。官曰。一雙清白眼。如何訴瞎。答曰。老爺看小人是清白的。小人看老爺是糊塗的。
`#wordplay
＊＊避暑
官值暑月。欲覔避暑之地。同僚紛義成曰。某山幽雅。［21］或曰某寺清閒。一老人進曰。搃不如此。公㕔上最凉也。官問何故。答曰此地有天無日頭。
＊＊天氣不正
有貴人于雪候居氊帷中。熾爐飲酒。々力薰灼。汗出。乃云天氣不正。一椽居帷外。稟曰。小人站䖏天氣頗正。
語儘可入世說。
＊＊封君
［22］有市井獲封者。初謁縣官。跼蹐甚。堅辭上坐。縣官曰。叻為令郎同年。理選該侍立。乃張目問曰。你也是属狗的麼。
又一人與縣官同坐。方揮扇。適茶至。藏扇不迭。遽插之衣領內。縣官大笑。
＊＊公子
一人問封君與公子孰樂。答曰。做封君齒已哀矣。惟公子最樂。其人急超而去。追問其故。曰欲送家父上［23］學。
有公子兼封君者。父對之欣羨不已。訝問其故。曰。你的爺既勝似我的爺。你的兒又勝似我的兒。
＊＊縣丞
`**County deputy
一丞不識字。凡買物即畵形簿上。令來。值丞不在。展簿視之。恠其所為。每行用硃筆直抺。丞歸視。怒曰。你衙內買紅燭。如何也記在我簿上。
`A deputy was illiterate, and so when he wanted to buy something he would draw a picture of it in his notebook. The magistrate came by, saw what was in his book, and piqued by it used red ink to strike out each line. The deputy came back and saw this, and angrily said, "if your court is planning to buy red candles, why write it in my book?"
＊＊典史
［24］衙官相遇。各問何職。一人曰。随常茶飯掇將來。盖義取見｛｛縣｝｝成｛｛丞｝｝也。一人曰。滾湯鍋裡下文書。盖煮｛｛主｝｝簿也。一人曰。鄉下蠻子租糞坑問者不解。答曰。典屎。｛｛史｝｝
若如此說還是典史近錢。
＊＊新替職
新替職揮使與父別居。嵗首往賀。值父未起。因留眷生帖。曰多致急往府縣。不得面拜矣。父怒甚。召而責之曰。汝如何用眷生帖拜我。子回首沉吟曰難道［25］我襲職之後。就不該認他做親眷了。
或者不是他令尊。莫恠他。
＊＊堵子
`**Target
一武官出征。將敗。忽有神兵助陣。反大勝。官叩頭請神姓名。神曰。我是{nn/堵子/nn}。官曰。小將何德。敢勞堵子尊神見救。答曰。感汝乎昔在教塲。從不曾一箭傷我。
`A military official was on campaign, and close to being beaten, when suddenly a supernatural being in the guise of a soldier turned the tide and helped him win a great victory. The official kowtowed and asked the spirit for his name. The spirit replied: "I am the Spirit of Targets." The official asked: "What virtue do I have, that I deserve the kind mercy and assistance of the Spirit of Targets?" He replied: "I'm grateful to you for when you were on the training field, you never once hit me with your arrows." 
``Also translated by Giles
如今武官不肯習射。豈死靠堵子報恩耶。
`Today's military officials are unwilling to practice archery, and put themselves exclusively at the mercy of the Spirit of Targets. 
＊＊夜巡
`**Night watch
［26］一武弁夜巡。有犯夜者。自稱書生會課歸遲。武弁曰。既是書生。且考你一考。生請題武弁思之。不得。唱曰。造化了你。今夜幸而沒有題目。
`A constable was doing his rounds of the night watch, to catch violators of the curfew. He caught one, who professed to be a student who was late in returning from classes. The constable told him, "since you say you are a student, then let me set you an examination topic. Would the scholar please expound upon the thoughts of the constable," When nothing was forthcoming, he said, "count yourself lucky! There is fortunately nothing to write about tonight,"
遼東一武職素不識字。被論。使人念劾本云。所當革任回衛者也。痛哭。曰。革任回衛。也是小事。這者乜兩箇字。怎麼當得起。有聞此語而笑者。余謂之曰。莫笑莫笑。近來天下事都在者乜之乎軰操縱中此武職痛哭何减賣太傅。［27］
＊＊太監
`**Eunuch
鎮守太監觀風。出後生可畏鳥為題。衆俱笑。璫問其故。教官禀曰。諸生以題目太難。求减得一字也好。璫笑曰。既如此。减後字。只做生可畏鳥罷。
或疑太監何以附古艷。曰。從來富貴的。有得幾箇不俯仰內相。［28］［29]
