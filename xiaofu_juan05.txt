``**Courtier
``The Jade Emperor fixed up the Palace of Virtuous Mist. Because he rarely used it, he wanted to rent out the Moon Palace to a human emperor. He thought that having an emperor in his court would be nice. And so he asked the Kitchen God to descend to the mortal world to discuss the terms of the lease. When he went to the (mortal) imperial court, they were shocked and said: "Why has the heavenly court sent a courtier who is as black as you?" The Kitchen God laughed and said: "In the mortal world, is there any courtier who is white (pure)?"

``The same joke could be made of matchmakers, physicians, and the like.
＊＊老翁
老翁與嫗行房。嫗恥其寬。以手向後撮緊。翁苦陽萎。亦以兩指夾之塞進。嫗嗔之。翁曰。你打後手。我怎不用些搭頭。
``**Old man
``An old man and woman were in bed together. The old woman was ashamed that she was too loose, and so used her hand to pinch it tighter together. The old man was worried that he was too soft, and so wedged it between two fingers and shoved it in. The old woman complained, and the old man said: "You held it from the back, so why can't I support it from the front?"
＊＊又
老翁續娶一嫗。其子夜往竊聽。但聞連呼快活爽利。子訝曰。吾父高年。尚有此老本事乎。及細察之。乃是命嫗抓背。
又老翁冬夜醉卧。置脚爐于被中。誤［爇］其腿。早起罵鄊鄰曰。我老人家多了幾杯酒。睡去了。你們後生家。難道燒人臭也不聞得。語亦可笑。
``**Old man (2)
``An old man remarried, taking as his wife an old woman. His son snuck around to eavesdrop one night, but heard cries of pleasure and excitement. The son was shocked and said to himself: "The old man's still got it in him, even though he's an old codger." But on a closer look, it turned out that he had only asked the old woman to scratch his back.
``Another old man went to bed drunk in the winter, and brought a brazier under covers with him. He burnt his leg, and the next morning went to scold the neighbors: "I'm an old man and had too many drinks and fell asleep. But you are young people! Couldn't you smell the burning flesh?" 
＊＊婢生子
有婢所生子既長。或問其號。子謙讓久之。乃云。賤號小梅。問尊公原號何梅。荅曰。非也。乃家母名臘梅耳。
``**A servant-girl's son
``The son of a servant girl was grown up, and someone asked him what was his pseudonym (hao). The son politely demurred for a long while, and then finally said: "My humble pseudonym is Sweet." "Did your late father's pseudonym also have the word 'sweet' in it?" He replied: "No, my mother's name was Wintersweet."
``[Doesn't translate well.]
或謂市井號多用少。小。紹。後類。一字相沿。累世不絕。可厭甚矣。余曰。古不諱名。即無號不更雅乎。且［166］今日某庵某所某齋。雪片皆是。與市井相沿何異。猶憶二十年前有以所字為號者。一時効之。凡齋庵之號。俱改為所。友人相遇問號。至云。尊號是甚所。尤可發㗛。
``It is said that pseudonyms with the characters shao (junior), xiao (little), shao (receive) and the like are very common in the marketplace. Once one character becomes popular, it persists for ages, which is annoying. After all, didn't the ancients not conceal their real names? It should be even more prestigious not to have a pseudonym. Anyway, these days it is common to have a pseudonym ending in an (monastery), suo (place), or zhai (residence). They are as abundant as snowflakes. What difference is there with the trends in the marketplace? I remember a time twenty years ago when the character suo (place) was for a moment so fashionable, that everyone who had zhai (residence) or an (monastery) in their pseudonyms all changed it to suo. When friends met up and exchanged pseudonyms, they would ask: "Where is your esteemed pseudonym?" which is especially funny.
＊＊朝奉
徽人狎妓。賣弄才學。臨睡。要各呈一故事。乃舒妓兩股。以其陰對己之陽。曰。此丹鳳｛｛縫｝｝朝陽也。妓亦以其陽對己之陰。徽人問曰。此何故事。妓曰。卵袋朝縫。
