`The Master of Mohan Studio says: Humans suffer from a myriad diseases, of which only custom has no cure. When there are customs of the flesh, there are also customs of manner. When there are customs of the inner organs, there are also customs of the outer shell. When there are customs of reputation, there are also customs of inheritance. Ziyu (Zengzi) said that there is no rancor between those who share the same customs. How might that be?

The guest then borrowed a knife and wanted to slaughter his own horse to provide for the meal. His host asked: "How would you go back home?" The guest said: "If I could trouble you to lend me a head from your flock, I can ride it home."

You have such a hard life serving him day and night." The door god replied: "I have no other choice." "Do you at least get something to eat?"

`A man was making dolls out of dough for sale. Business was doing well, and he told his wife: "Let's start making them with their hands held together. In that way, we can save on some flour." They still sold well, and so he said: "Let's make them sitting down. We'll save on even more dough that way." They nonetheless still sold well, and so he said: "Let's make them lying down instead, and save still some more." When they actually made them, the wife had a look and said: "Saving is all well and good, but I think they don't really look like people any more."

`A monkey died and met the King of Hades. He begged to be reborn as a human. The King said: "Since you want to be human, we'll first need to pluck out all your fur."

`A woman felt that wooden toilets were too easily broken, and wanted to have one made from tin, which would be more durable. Someone quoted a figure of five pounds of tin. Shocked, she rejected it as being too expensive. When another said he could make it with one pound, she also found that excessive. Finally, someone said that he could make it with only three taels. She was very happy, and asked: "How would you make it with three taels?" The tinsmith said: "I'll just hammer out a tin spoon. When m'lady wishes to answer the call of nature, she can just ladle it out."

`A poor scholar bumped into an old acquaintance on the road. The old acquaintance in the meanwhile had already become an immortal. When the scholar had finished listing all his woes, the other man touched a stray brick lying by the road with his finger, turned it into pure gold, and presented it to him. The scholar complained that it was too little, so the other man touched a large stone lion, and presented that to him. The scholar still complained that it wasn't enough. The immortal said: "What do you want, then?" The scholar said: "That finger of yours."

`There was a man who built a toilet with an eye to profit from it. He saw in the distance a man who was beginning to undo his robe, and knew that he must be on his way to pee, but was afraid that he would patronize the neighbor's toilet instead. He therefore posed as someone who needed to shit, and went to occupy the neighbor's toilet. While crouched there he could tell that the other man went to do his small business in the toilet that he built. After some time crouching, he inadvertently let out a fart, and some shit too, into his neighbor's toilet. At this he sighed deeply and said with regret: "Ah to lose big business for a small one."

`A pair of brothers were planting a field together. The millet was ripe for harvest, and they were discussing how to split the yields. The older brother told the younger: "I'll take the upper half, and you'll take the lower half." The younger brother was shocked and said that this wouldn't be fair. The brother replied: "Don't worry. Next year, you'll take the upper half, and I'll take the lower half." Next year, the younger brother was urging the elder to sow the fields. The elder said: "This year, we should plant taro."

The servant replied: "There's no one about these parts." And so the man relaxed his shoulders, saying: "Since there's no one here, I'm going to take a break."

When someone mentioned how big was the Dragon's Coat Boat, he said: "That's just like the little skiff we have at home."

`There was a servant of a high-ranking official. When the official farted, the servant said: "There wafts a southerly fragrance." The official was embarrassed, and said: "I heard that farts emanate from the intestines, and should properly be smelly. If it is fragrant, could it not be an inauspicious sign?"

有惧內而好裝體面者。對客屢呼茶不至。餙為怒。且罵。自走取茶。妻伏屏後。見夫至。連批其頰其人忍痛急轉曰。我專怪你不支持茶出來。
`There was a man who was henpecked but who liked to keep up appearances. When he had guests over, he called for more tea but it didn't come. He pretended to be angry, scolded his wife, and went to get the tea himself. His wife was hiding behind a screen. Seeing her husband come, she smacked him repeatedly on the cheeks. The man winced and quickly said to her: "I was only saying that you weren't encouraging the tea to come out." 
＊＊避打
`**Avoiding a beating
一人被妻打無奈。鑚在床下。妻呼曰。快々出來。荅曰。男子大丈夫。說不出來。定不出來。［35］
`A man couldn't stand being beaten by his wife any more, and so he hid under the bed. The wife called to him: "You'd better get out!" He replied: "A real man stands by his word! I said I wouldn't come out, so I won't!"
如今為男子大丈夫者。大半皆此軰也。可嘆可嘆。
`The so-called "real men" of today are mostly of this sort. It's a real pity. 
＊＊記酒
`**How much wine?
有觴客者。其妻每出酒一壺。即將［鍋］煤畫于臉上。記數。主人索酒不已。童子曰。少吃幾壺罷。家主婆臉上有些不好看了
`A man had some guests over at his home for drinks. Every time his wife warmed up a new pot of wine for them, she made a stroke on her face with the soot from the cauldron to keep count. The man kept on calling up more wine from the kitchen. Eventually, the servant-boy said to him: "Do slow down with the wine; Madam's face is becoming quite hard to look at." 
＊＊曆日
一官置妾。畏妻。不得自由紿曰。我只得奏一本去。乃以黃袱裹綾曆一册。從外擎回曰。本已在此。妻頗懷［36］惧。一日。夫出。妻私啟視。見正月大。二月小。喜云。原來皇帝也有大小。看三月大。四月小。都無語。至五月大。六月大。七月大。即怒云。如何熱＝上執＝天都分與我
＊＊正夫綱
`**Male prerogative
衆怕婆者相聚。欲議一不怕之法以正夫綱。或恐之曰。列位尊嫂聞知。已相約即刻一齊打至矣。衆駭然奔散。惟一人坐定。疑此人獨不怕者也。察之則已驚［死］矣。［37］
`A group of henpecked husbands were having a meeting. They wanted to find a way to stop fearing their wives and restore their male prerogative. Then someone said to them fearfully: "Gentlemen, our wives have found out about this meeting, and are planning on coming to teach us a harsh lesson!" The group immediately dispersed in all directions, except for one man who sat fast in place. Everyone thought that he was the only one there who had no fear, but it turned out that he had simply died from the fright.
＊＊婆像
`**Portrait
一怕婆者。婆既［死］。見婆像懸于柩側。因理舊恨。以拳擬之。忽風吹軸動。大驚忙縮手曰。我是取笑。
`A henpecked man was lately widowed. Leaning on the wife's coffin was her portrait. Owing to his long pent-up resentment, he was going to smack the portrait, but just at that moment a gust of wind blew and made it move. The man hurriedly drew back his hand and said: "I was just kidding!" 
＊＊節哀酒
`**Releasing-sorrow wine
吳俗送火葬者。親友移酒勞孝子。謂之節哀。一人出父殯。領節哀酒。盡醉而歸。視其母笑哈々不止。母怒曰。痴烏龜。死了爺有甚快活。看了我。只管笑。荅曰。我看你身上還有一醉。［38］
`The people of the Wu region have a custom of cremation; at the funeral, friends and family will bring wine to console the bereaved son. This is called "relieving sorrow". A man had just performed the last rites for his father, and received the relieving-sorrow wine. Completely drunk, he stumbled his way home. When he saw his mother, he fell about himself with laughter. His mother was furious, saying: "You useless fool, how dare you be in such good spirits after your father has just died! How can you face me while laughing?" He replied: "With you here, I know that I still have another opportunity to get drunk." 
一說母怒曰。爺［死］了有甚快活。喫得爛醉。子睨曰。扯淡。可是你作成我的。亦好。
`Another version says that the mother was furious, saying: "How dare you go and have such fun after your father died? Drunk and falling about!" The son looked at her groggily and said: "Shut your trap. It was you who raised such a son." 
＊＊各爨
`**Separate hearths
有父子同赴宴。父上坐。而子逕就對席者。同席疑之。問上席是令尊否。曰。雖是家父。然各爨人矣。
`A father and son were attending the same banquet. The father sat at the table of honor, while the son joined the facing table. Those at his table were curious, and asked him if that was his father at the high table. He replied: "Although that is my father, we keep separate hearths." 
＊＊銀會
銀會之弊今日極矣。有人拉有作會。友固拒之。不得。乃曰。汝若要我與會。除是跪我。其人即下跪。乃許之。［39］旁觀者誚曰。些須會銀。左右要還他的。如此自屈。吾甚不取。荅曰。我不折本也。他日討會錢時。拜我的日子正多哩。
一人對客忽轉身曰。兄且坐。我欲進去兌還一主會錢。即出奉陪。纔進內。便出。客問何不兌銀。其人笑曰。我曾筭來。他是痴的。所以把錢與我。々若去還他。也是痴的。
＊＊說謊
`**Liar
［40］有慣說謊者。謂衆曰。我昨晚自山間歸。見一蛇。長數百丈。高五六尺。衆曰。此山中安得有數百丈之蛇。其人曰。即無數百丈。數十丈也有。衆曰。即數十丈。亦無之。其人連减至數丈。衆猶未信。乃沉吟曰。怎麼䖏。將次方了。
`A habitual liar told a crowd of people: "Last night I was coming back from the mountain, when I came across a snake that was a hundred yards long and five or six feet high!" The crowd said: "There can't be a hundred-yard-long snake in this mountain." The liar said: "Okay, even if it wasn't a hundred yards long it was at least ten yards long." The crowd said: "There's no such thing, even at ten yards." The liar kept revising his estimate downwards, while the crowd kept on being skeptical. Eventually he said in despair: "If it were any shorter it would be shaped like a cube!"
舊唐書載天寶中。有蛇高一丈。長十丈。見北印山下。胡僧曰。水妖也。咒以天竺法。蛇自［死］此說尚未是謊。［41］

`Two brothers placed a bet with each other. Henceforth they would speak to each other with lies. If one should be surprised by a lie, then he would have to pay the other a tael of silver. One day the elder brother said: "The water in our village well is so exceedingly fine that last night someone tried to steal the well. When people got wind of it, they gave chase, and the thief threw it by the wayside, whereupon it broke into three pieces." The younger brother was surprised, saying: "Was there such a thing?" The elder brother told him to pay up. The younger said that he would give him the money tomorrow. The next afternoon rolled around, but the younger brother had still not showed up. His elder brother went to call on him, and found his brother still unwashed. He asked what was going on, and the younger said: "A strange thing happened last night. My wife had pains in her belly, and in the middle of the night, gave birth to seventeen or eighteen little boys!" The elder brother was shocked: "Was there such a thing?" The younger said: "Your turn."

`There was a man who was notorious for dawdling. He was walking very slowly one late afternoon, when the night watchman saw him outside the city walls. The watchman asked: "Where are you going?" "Back to my house." Whereupon the watchman arrested him for breaking the curfew and wanted to bring him before a magistrate. The man protested: "It's not yet dark! How could I have been breaking the curfew?" The watchman replied: "With the way that you dawdle, before you reach your front door it would already be two past midnight."
舊嘲踱足。令易嘲善踱者。甚妙

`There was a household that worshipped all three faiths. Offerings were made to the idols in the following order: first Confucius, then the Buddha, then Laozi. A Daoist adept saw this, and moved Laozi to the center. A Buddhist monk saw this, and moved the Buddha to the center. A Confucian scholar saw this and moved Confucius to the center. The three sages said among themselves: "We were doing so well for ourselves, but these people have really messed things up by moving us around like that!"

`Someone was passing through a wasteland when he saw human bones exposed on the ground. Taking pity on the poor soul, he reburied the bones. At night he heard a knocking on his door. He asked who it was, and the reply: "Fei." He asked again, and the reply: "I am Yang Fei (the Consort Yang, one of the four great beauties of China). I came to grief at Ma Wei, and my remains were not given a proper burial. I am grateful to you, sir, for burying my bones, and I am here to share your pillow in appreciation." And so he accepted her offer with great glee. The neighbor overheard this and was jealous. He went to scout out the wasteland, and chanced upon some exposed bones, which he buried. At night, there was a knocking on his door. He asked who it was, and the reply: "Fei." He asked: "Are you the consort Yang Fei?" But the reply came: "I am Zhang Fei." The neighbor was shocked, and loudly asked: "Why has General Zhang come back to this world?" He replied: "I came to grief at Lang Zhong, and my remains were not given a proper burial. I am grateful to you, sir, for burying my bones, and I have specially come to offer my hairy bum in appreciation."
