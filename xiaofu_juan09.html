<div class="translation"><p>A new bride (on her way to be married) was crying pitifully on the journey. The boatman could not bear it, and wanted to stop the boat. At this point the woman said: "My job is to cry, and yours is to row the boat. Mind your own business!"</p></div>
<p>［57］一說轎夫聞哭甚哀。曰。小娘子。且擡你轉去何如。女應曰。如今不哭了。</p>
<div class="translation"><p>Another version: Sedan carriers felt much pity on hearing the sobs of a new bride, and so said to her: "How about if I just take you back?" She said: "I'll stop crying right away."</p></div>

<div class="translation"><p>A new bride was on her way to be married, when the bottom suddenly fell out of her sedan-chair. The chair-bearers conferred with each other, and told the bride that they could not continue. They had to get a new sedan-chair, but it was a long way if they wanted to turn back. The bride heard this, and said: "I have a plan." They were all cheered, and asked what it was. She said: "You can carry on as usual on the outside, and I'll stay inside and walk." </p></div>

<div class="translation"><p>A man from a poor family was about to marry a bride from a rich family. The groom's family was afraid that the bride's family would break the engagement, and so on the appointed day, the groom went in to snatch the bride. By mistake, he grabbed the bride's maiden aunt. The bride's family chased after him, calling out: "You've grabbed the wrong person!" The maiden aunt on his back said: "Don't mind them, I'm the right one, keep running!"</p></div>

<div class="translation"><p>A bride-to-be was very gassy. Accompanying her at her wedding were an old woman and a servant girl, who were to provide cover for her embarrasing problem. At the marriage ceremony, she let loose a fart. Turning to the old woman on her right, she said "this old nanny!" Not long afterwards, she let loose another fart. Turning to the servant girl on her left, she said, "this little wench!" Not long after, she farted again, but turning to both sides, both the old woman and the servant girl were gone. And so she said, "this butt hole!"</p></div>

<div class="translation"><p>A man was persuading his new bride to disrobe. She said: "My mother told me that being naked is shameful. I cannot disobey my mother. But my husband tells me to disrobe, and I cannot disobey my husband either."

Once more he said: "Your brother didn't even bother to say a word to me, but today I get my way!" He thrust again, and then was spent. The bride said: "My sister-in-law is also always bad mouthing you!" </p></div>
<p>可惜新婦不曾作難。不然還有一次。</p>

<div class="translation"><p>A guest was at lunch, when the conversation turned to gourds, which were supposed to diminish the libido, unlike leeks which fortify it.

<div class="translation"><p>A man fell sick from indulging in too much sex and wine. The physician told him: "this is like burning a candle at both ends.

The physician sensed what she wanted to say, and immediately continued: "but if you can't give up sex, you should at least hold back on the wine." The patient asked, "isn't sex more harmful than wine, and easier to abstain from?" His wife retorted: "if you don't listen to the good doctor how are you ever going to get well?"</p></div>
