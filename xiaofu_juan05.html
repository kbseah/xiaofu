<div class="translation"><p>It is said that pseudonyms with the characters shao (junior), xiao (little), shao (receive) and the like are very common in the marketplace. Once one character becomes popular, it persists for ages, which is annoying. After all, didn't the ancients not conceal their real names? It should be even more prestigious not to have a pseudonym. Anyway, these days it is common to have a pseudonym ending in an (monastery), suo (place), or zhai (residence). They are as abundant as snowflakes. What difference is there with the trends in the marketplace? I remember a time twenty years ago when the character suo (place) was for a moment so fashionable, that everyone who had zhai (residence) or an (monastery) in their pseudonyms all changed it to suo. When friends met up and exchanged pseudonyms, they would ask: "Where is your esteemed pseudonym?" which is especially funny.</p></div>
