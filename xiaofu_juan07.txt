＊＊細娛部
`**Refined amusements
墨憨子曰。樂極必悲。勝極必負。自然之數也。闞客之後。流為閒漢。賭塲之中。必有偷兒。君子亦何必硜々然粧道學腔哉。妙在適興而已。集細娛部。
`The Master of Mohan Studio says: Excessive merry-making must end in grief; too much winning will prove burdensome. This is a natural law of numbers. After going to the whore-house, one drifts as a man of leisure. In every gambling den, there will always be a loser. Why should a gentleman superficially pretend to adopt the ways of a dusty old scholar? It is only a wonder if one is suddenly awakened to the truth.
＊＊闞
`**Whoring
客與妓宿。中夜。妓謂客曰。頗思量娘子否。荅曰。他不思量我。我如何思量他。妓曰。汝何以之娘子不思量{pp/212/pp}也。荅曰。似我這一箇好闞的。你道他思量我也不。
`A john was lying with a prostitute. In the middle of the night, she asked him: "Do you think about your wife?" He replied: "She doesn't think about me, so why should I think about her?" The prostitute said: "How are you so sure she doesn't think about you?" He replied: "Do you really think that my wife would spend much time thinking about a whore-lover like me?"
＊＊又
`**Whoring (2)
妓謂客曰。你便在此作要。你娘子寡在家裡。客曰。他到不寡。妓驚問曰。何以不寡。荅曰。你試詳情。他若是寡在那裡。怎肯放我出來。
`A prostitute said to her john: "You are out having fun here, but your wife is all lonely at home." He said, "she is not lonely." The prostitute was shocked and asked how could she not be lonely. He replied: "Just try to imagine. If she was feeling lonely, would she have let me out the house?"
有此虐謔遂令醋婦藉口。
＊＊又
`**Whoring (3)
闞客自妓館歸。妻問曰。這些淫婦。徑［過］了千萬箇人。{pp/213/pp}此物一定寬了。有甚好處。你歡喜他。荅曰。不知怎麼緣故。但是名妓。越接得客多。此物越好。妻曰。原來如此。極易事。何不早說。
`A john returned home from a brothel. His wife asked him: "These lewd women have lain with thousands of men, they must be really loose down there. How can it be fun for you?" He replied: "I don't know how it works, but with these famous prostitutes, the more customers they have, the better their thing becomes." The wife said: "So that's what it is. If it was so easy, why didn't you tell me earlier?"
＊＊又
一闞客闞盡。遂留妓家服役。乃懸瓦一片。磚一塊。遮其前後。聞有徽客謀為妓造房者。因謂曰。朝奉只出木頭罷。磚瓦都在我身上。
妓問一徽客曰。朝奉賣何寶貨。荅曰。賣幾根小木{pp/214/pp}頭。妓以為木客也。甚奉之。及細訪。乃擺刀柴于街上賣者。然則出木頭的。亦未可信。
＊＊賭
`**Gambler
一人好賭。日夜不歸。已破家。止剩一妻。乃以出稍。不幾擲。復輸去。因請再饒一擲。贏家曰。講絕了稍做事。如何又饒。荅曰。有一緣故。房下還是室女。贏家曰。那有此理。荅曰。若不信。你只問我從做親來。那一夜住在家裡。{pp/215/pp}
`A man gambled day and night without ever going home. He lost everything that he had, except for his wife, and soon he wagered her too. However, only after a few rolls of the dice, he also lost her. He then begged to be allowed a few more rolls of the dice. The winner said: "You've already lost everything that you could wager. Why should you get any more rolls?" The man replied: "My wife should be worth a few more turns because she's still a virgin." The winner said: "How could that possibly be?" The man replied: "What's there not to be believe? Have you ever seen me spend a night in my own bedroom?"
王無夢好賭。所得賣文錢。盡以佐呼盧費。王元美問其得意何在。荅曰。爾時偏喜其面真。

按君訪察。匡章。陳仲子。及齊人。俱被捉。匡自信孝子。{pp/216/pp}陳清客。俱不請托。惟齊人以其一妻一妾送顯者求觧。顯者為見按君。按君述三人罪狀。都是敗壞風俗的頭目。所以訪之。顯者曰。匡章出妻屏子。仲子離母避兄。老大人捉得極當。那齊人是呌化子的頭。捉他甚麼。
有偉丈夫至閶門。謂人曰。有名這一箇大馬頭。如何賭錢的也沒有一箇。人問曰。老丈莫非要賭。荅曰。非也。要撚幾箇頭耳。因思昔人有賣賭錢不輸{pp/217/pp}方者。封緘甚密。一富兒以千金得之。啟視撚頭二字也。可發一笑。
＊＊稍
賭客之子在學堂。聞人說銀子二字。疑甚。索而觀之。曰。此即汝家所謂銀子乎。曰。然。曰。汝哄我耳。這件東西我家喚做見綃。｛｛見音現｝｝
舊說嘲餘姚先生喚銀為束修。今移。嘲賭客。尤有關係。{pp/218/pp}
＊＊敗
`**Wastrel
或勸敗子曰。敗子，回頭便作家。敗子曰。你可曉得我從幼是強頸麼。

`In playing chess one of the most annoying things is to have bystanders who talk too much. A and B were playing chess. An observer kept telling A how to play, and would not shut up. B was furious, and punched him in the face. The man was in pain but kept going. With one hand he held his face, and with the other he wagged his finger at the board and told A: "shouldn't you take his pawn by now?"
問如何又教。荅曰。專怪他打我。
`When asked why he persisted in giving advice, he replied, "especially because he hit me."

`A guest litterateur was complaining about household matters in the summer: "It is commonly said that to run a household, you need seven things. To date I have found that you actually need nine. Without them, life is hard." When asked what were the additional two, he said: "The stalks of jasmine flowers from this morning are a must. And how can you live without this mosquito repellent incense at night?"
清客只有茉莉花。蚊烟兩件。那有九件。問何故。田柴米油塩醬醋茶。般々都靠別人家。
`The guest litterateur only mentioned jasmine flowers and mosquito repellent. But this doesn't make up nine. The rest are: farmland, firewood, rice, oil, salt, fermented sauce, vinegar, and tea. For all these he relies on the hospitality of his host.

＊＊荇葉
清客貧甚。煮荇葉食之。而出赴富兒席。飲空心酒［過］多。遂大噦。而荇葉出焉。乃指而言曰。早上喫白滚湯時。用不多幾箇蓮心。如何小荷葉出得恁快。{pp/223/pp}

`A guardian deity encountered a road-opening idol, and said enviously to him: "You and I are about the same size and stature. How do I get to eat and dress as well as you do?" The road-opening idol said: "Brother, you don't know that I only get to hunger after some snacks. As for clothing, it's completely useless. Peel away the layer of paint, and I'm just a bamboo strip beneath."
